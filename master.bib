	abstract = {Mechanisms underlying severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease remain poorly understood. We analyze several thousand plasma proteins longitudinally in 306 COVID-19 patients and 78 symptomatic controls, uncovering immune and non-immune proteins linked to COVID-19. Deconvolution of our plasma proteome data using published scRNA-seq datasets reveals contributions from circulating immune and tissue cells. Sixteen percent of patients display reduced inflammation yet comparably poor outcomes. Comparison of patients who died to severely ill survivors identifies dynamic immune-cell-derived and tissue-associated proteins associated with survival, including exocrine pancreatic proteases. Using derived tissue-specific and cell-type-specific intracellular death signatures, cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, and our data, we infer whether organ damage resulted from direct or indirect effects of infection. We propose a model in which interactions among myeloid, epithelial, and T cells drive tissue damage. These datasets provide important insights and a rich resource for analysis of mechanisms of severe COVID-19 disease.},

	n2 = {Purpose of review The renin--angiotensin system (RAS) is a pivotal player in the physiology and pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal systems. Discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), capable of cleaving RAS effector peptide angiotensin (Ang) II into biologically active Ang-(1--7), has increased the complexity of our knowledge of the RAS. ACE2 expression is abundant in the kidney and is thought to provide protection against injury. This review emphasizes current experimental and clinical findings that examine ACE2 in the context of kidney injury and its potential therapeutic impact for treatment of kidney disease. Recent findings Clinical studies have reported upregulation of ACE2 in urine from diabetic patients, which may be reflective of pathological shedding of renal ACE2 as suggested by mechanistic experiments. Studies in experimental models have investigated the feasibility of pharmacological induction of ACE2 for improvement of renal function, inflammation, and fibrosis. Summary Emerging concepts about the RAS indicate that ACE2 is a critical regulator of angiotensin peptide metabolism and the pathogenesis of renal disease. Human recombinant ACE2 is available and may be a practical clinical approach to enzyme replacement. Elucidating precise roles of ACE2 throughout disease progression will enrich our view of the RAS and help identify novel targets and appropriate strategies for intervention.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background Coagulopathy is a common abnormality in patients with COVID-19. However, the exact incidence of venous thromboembolic event is unknown in anticoagulated, severe COVID-19 patients. Objectives Systematic assessment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) using complete duplex ultrasound (CDU) in anticoagulated COVID-19 patients. Patients and methods We performed a retrospective study in 2 French intensive care units (ICU) where CDU is performed as a standard of care. A CDU from thigh to ankle at selected sites with Doppler waveforms and images was performed early during ICU stay in patients admitted with COVID-19. Anticoagulation dose was left to the discretion of the treating physician based on the individual risk of thrombosis. Patients were classified as treated with prophylactic anticoagulation or therapeutic anticoagulation. Pulmonary embolism was systematically searched in patients with persistent hypoxemia or secondary deterioration. Results From March 19 to April 11, 2020, 26 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 were screened for VTE. Eight patients (31\%) were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas 18 patients (69\%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. The overall rate of VTE in patients was 69\%. The proportion of VTE was significantly higher in patients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation when compared with the other group (100\% vs 56\%, respectively, P = .03). Surprisingly, we found a high rate of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, with 56\% of VTE and 6 pulmonary embolisms. Conclusion Our results suggest considering both systematic screening of VTE and early therapeutic anticoagulation in severe ICU COVID-19 patients.},

The test, a useful tool in differentiation of thrombocytopenic states, has now been carried out for autoimmune disorders, but data are yet scarce. Controversial results have been obtained in systemic and organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Another test, the immature platelet fraction (IPF) reflects the amount of young, reticulated platelets. IPF is calculated by automated hematology analysis or flow cytometry, and it is usually high in patients with rapid platelet destruction. For both MPV and IPF, standardization of cutoff is a major need. In this review, we focus the current applicability of MPV and IPF as biomarkers in patients with autoimmune diseases.},

Between 1988 and 2002, the incidence of ARF rose from 61 to 288 per 100,000 population; the incidence of ARF-D increased from 4 to 27 per 100,000 population. Between 1988 and 2002, in-hospital mortality declined steadily in patients with ARF (40.4 to 20.3\%; P \&lt; 0.001) and in those with ARF-D (41.3 to 28.1\%; P \&lt; 0.001). Compared with 1988 to 1992, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death was lower in 1993 to 1997 (ARF: OR 0.62, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 0.64; ARF-D: OR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.59 to 0.66) and 1998 to 2002 (ARF: OR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.39 to 0.41; ARF-D: OR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.45 to 0.50). The percentage of patients who had ARF with a Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index of 3 or more increased from 16.4\% in 1988 to 26.6\% in 2002 (P \&lt; 0.001). This study provides evidence from an administrative database that the incidence of ARF and ARF-D is rising. Despite an increase in the degree of comorbidity, in-hospital mortality has declined.},

	abstract = {Platelet shape change (PSC) is an early phase of platelet activation that precedes platelet aggregation. This phase of platelet activation is essentially aspirin resistant. PSC was monitored, by measuring the median platelet volume (MPV) using a high resolution channelyser. Angiotensin (Ang) II, added in vitro, caused a significant (P = 0.004) increase in MPV in platelet rich plasma prepared from healthy subjects (n = 14). This increase in MPV was marked (>0.40 fl) in 57{\%} (n = 8) of these subjects and was significantly inhibited (P < 0.008) by losartan (a selective ang ii antagonist) at concentrations similar to those achieved in the circulation during treatment. ang ii also significantly enhanced sub-maximal psc induced by adp and serotonin in all subjects tested. losartan significantly (n = 9; P < 0.001) inhibited u46619 (a thromboxane a2 analogue)-induced PSC. These findings suggest that losartan, in addition to its blood pressure lowering action, has antiplatelet activity. This property may be clinically relevant because of the increased risk of vascular events in hypertensive patients.},

	abstract = {The existence of local or tissue-based renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems (RAAS) is well documented and has been implicated as a key player in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal diseases. The kidney contains all elements of the RAAS, and intrarenal formation of angiotensin II not only controls glomerular hemodynamics and tubule sodium transport, but also activates a number of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that the intrarenal RAAS is activated early in diabetic nephropathy, the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers decrease the rate of decline in kidney function in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy, many patients still progress to end-stage renal disease or die from cardiovascular events. There is still a clear need for additional strategies to block the RAAS more effectively to reduce progression of CKD. The focus of this paper is to review the importance of the intrarenal RAAS in CKD and recent findings in renin-angiotensin biology pertinent to the kidney. We also discuss additional strategies to inhibit the RAAS more effectively and the potential impact of direct renin inhibition on the prevention and management of CKD.},

@article{LiumedRxiv:2020,
	abstract = {Background 2019 Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is turning into a pandemic globally lately. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as an important functional receptor for SARS-Cov-2. ACE2 and ACE are homologues with inverse functions in the renin{\textendash}angiotensin system. ACE converts angiotensin I into a vital vasoactive peptide called angiotensin II(AngII), whereas ACE2 hydrolyzes AngII into a series of vasodilators. There were few reports illustrated the expression of AngII in COVID-19. This study aimed to demonstrate the expression of angiotensin II in COVID-19 and how it correlated to the disease.Methods We enrolled 55 patients with COVID-19 admitted to renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 21st to February 21st, 2020. Demographic data were collected upon admission. COVID-19 nuclear acid, plasma AngII, Renin and aldosterone in the lying position without sodium restriction, and other laboratory indicators were together measured by the laboratory department of our hospital.Findings Of the 55 patients with COVID-19, 34(61.8\%) had an increased level of AngII. The severity of COVID-19 and male is positively related with the level of AngII. The level of blood lymphocyte, PCT, ALT, and AST were remarkably severe with those of normal level of AngII (P \&lt; 0.05). CD4/CD8 cells ratio was significantly higher whereas CD3+CD8+ cells amount, CD3+CD8+ cells proportion, CD56+CD16+CD3- cells amount and CD19+CD3- cells amount were considerably lower than those of normal level of AngII (P \&lt; 0.05). Abnormal rates of blood lymphocyte and PCT were significantly higher in Patients with elevated AngII level. The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 (OR=4.123) and CD4/CD8 ratio(OR=4.050) were the co-directional impact factor while female(OR=0.146) was inverse impact factor of elevated AngII level.Interpretation High rate of increased level of AngII was detected in COVID-19 patients. Patients with elevated AngII level were more likely to be critically ill with COVID-19. Considering the gender differences in ACE2 expression and no gender differences in angiotensin expression, the gender differences in AngII level might indicate less loss of ACE2 in female patients. Elevated AngII level was correlated with CD4/CD8 ratio, suggesting it might involve in immune disorder.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Basic Research Project of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (JCYJ20160429181842402).

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the activation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2/angiotensin-(1--7)/Mas receptor axis by use of a novel ACE2 activator (XNT) would protect against thrombosis. Thrombi were induced in the vena cava of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, and ACE2 and ACE activity in the thrombus was determined. Real-time thrombus formation was viewed through intravital microscopy of vessels in nude mice. Thrombus weight was 40{\%} greater in the SHR (4.99 $\pm$0.39 versus 7.04 $\pm$0.66 mg). This weight increase was associated with a 20{\%} decrease in ACE2 activity in the thrombus. In contrast, there were no differences between the WKY and SHR in ACE2 protein and ACE activity in the thrombi. ACE2 inhibition (DX600; 0.1 mol/L/kg) increased thrombus weight by 30{\%} and XNT treatment (10 mg/kg) resulted in a 30{\%} attenuation of thrombus formation in the SHR. Moreover, XNT reduced platelet attachment to injured vessels, reduced thrombus size, and prolonged the time for complete vessel occlusion in mice. Thus, a decrease in thrombus ACE2 activity is associated with increased thrombus formation in SHR. Furthermore, ACE2 activation attenuates thrombus formation and reduces platelet attachment to vessels. These results suggest that ACE2 could be a novel target for the treatment of thrombogenic diseases.},

	abstract = {Abstract Objective AngII-induced HTN is associated with accelerated thrombus development in arterioles. This study assessed the contributions of different components of the coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis to AngII-mediated microvascular thrombosis. Methods Light/dye-induced thrombus formation (the time of onset and flow cessation) was quantified in cremaster muscle arterioles of AngII infused (two weeks) WT/AngII mice, EPCR-TgN, and mice deficient in PAI-1. WT/AngII mice were also treated with either tissue factor antibody, antithrombin III, heparin, hirudin, or murine APC. Results TF immunoblockade or hirudin treatment did not prevent the AngII-induced acceleration of thrombosis. While antithrombin III treatment prevented the acceleration in both thrombus onset and flow cessation, heparin only improved the time for blood flow cessation. Neither WT mice treated with murine APC nor EPCR-TgN were protected against AngII-induced thrombus development. A similar lack of protection was noted in PAI-1deficient mice. Conclusion These findings implicate a role for thrombin generation pathway in the accelerated thrombosis induced by AngII and suggest that an impaired protein C pathway and increased PAI-1 do not make a significant contribution to this model of microvascular thrombosis.},

@article{KimPeptides:2012,
	abstract = {Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) shares some homology with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) but is not inhibited by ACE inhibitors. The main role of ACE2 is the degradation of Ang II resulting in the formation of angiotensin 1\&{\#}x2013;7 (Ang 1\&{\#}x2013;7) which opposes the actions of Ang II. Increased Ang II levels are thought to upregulate ACE2 activity, and in ACE2 deficient mice Ang II levels are approximately double that of wild-type mice, whilst Ang 1\&{\#}x2013;7 levels are almost undetectable. Thus, ACE2 plays a crucial role in the RAS because it opposes the actions of Ang II. Consequently, it has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease where its expression is decreased. Not surprisingly, current therapeutic strategies for ACE2 involve augmenting its expression using ACE2 adenoviruses, recombinant ACE2 or compounds in these diseases thereby affording some organ protection.},

	abstract = {Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route. A distinct coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain). The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS-CoV. This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.

The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.},

@article{LodigianiThrombosis:2020,
	abstract = {Background
Few data are available on the rate and characteristics of thromboembolic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We studied consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy (13.02.2020{\^a}10.04.2020). The primary outcome was any thromboembolic complication, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary outcome was overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Results
We included 388 patients (median age 66{\^A} years, 68% men, 16% requiring intensive care [ICU]). Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward. Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4%{\^a}11.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward). Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24{\^A} h of hospital admission. Forty-four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA). The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients.
Conclusions
The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24{\^A} h of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.},

@article{TahaCOVID19Platelets:2020,
	abstract = {{The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable viral infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS?CoV?2 utilizes metallocarboxyl peptidase angiotensin receptor (ACE) 2 to gain entry into human cells. Activation of several proteases facilitates the interaction of viral spike proteins (S1) and ACE2 receptor. This leads to cleavage of host ACE2 receptors. ACE2 activity counterbalances the angiotensin II effect, its loss may lead to elevated angiotensin II levels with modulation of platelet function, size and activity. COVID-19 disease encompasses a spectrum of systemic involvement far beyond respiratory failure alone. Several features of this disease, including the etiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the hypercoagulable state, remain poorly understood. Here, we show that there is a high incidence of AKI (81\%) in the critically ill adults with COVID-19 in the setting of elevated D-dimer, elevated ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Strikingly, there were unique features of platelets in these patients, including larger, more granular platelets and a higher mean platelet volume (MPV). There was a significant correlation between measured D-dimer levels and MVP; but a negative correlation between MPV and glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in critically ill cohort. Our data suggest that activated platelets may play a role in renal failure and possibly hypercoagulability status in COVID19 patients.}},

An alarming number of cases have arisen where COVID‐19 patients develop complications on top of the symptoms already associated with SARS, such as thrombosis, injuries of vascular system, kidney, and liver, as well as Kawasaki disease. In this review, a bioinformatics approach was used to elucidate the immune response triggered by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in primary human lung epithelial and transformed human lung alveolar. Additionally, examined the potential mechanism behind several complications that have been associated with COVID‐19 and determined that a specific cytokine storm is leading to excessive neutrophil recruitment. These neutrophils are directly leading to thrombosis, organ damage, and complement activation via neutrophil extracellular trap release. SARS‐Cov‐2 induces a specific cytokine profile, which induces the excessive release of extracellular traps by various cell types and leads to a prothrombotic environment.}},

@article{WalkerOVCApanel:2021,
	abstract = {{The survival of patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer depends largely on the extent of the disease upon diagnosis. When confined to the ovaries, patients' 10-year survival is more than 70\%. This drastically drops to less than 5\% when patients are diagnosed with far-advanced disease. Unfortunately, more than 80\% of patients are diagnosed at advanced stage due to the lack of test for early detection. We report the development of a blood test measuring four proteins (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, osteopontin, prolactin and cancer antigen 125), which can distinguish ovarian cancer samples, even early-stage disease, from healthy samples in the population tested. This study is another step towards the application of a useful test for early detection of ovarian cancer that is both highly accurate and specific. Background: Mortality from ovarian cancer remains high due to the lack of methods for early detection. The difficulty lies in the low prevalence of the disease necessitating a significantly high specificity and positive-predictive value (PPV) to avoid unneeded and invasive intervention. Currently, cancer antigen- 125 (CA-125) is the most commonly used biomarker for the early detection of ovarian cancer. In this study we determine the value of combining macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), osteopontin (OPN), and prolactin (PROL) with CA-125 in the detection of ovarian cancer serum samples from healthy controls. Materials and Methods: A total of 432 serum samples were included in this study. 153 samples were from ovarian cancer patients and 279 samples were from age-matched healthy controls. The four proteins were quantified using a fully automated, multi-analyte immunoassay. The serum samples were divided into training and testing datasets and analyzed using four classification models to calculate accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The four-protein biomarker panel yielded an average accuracy of 91\% compared to 85\% using CA-125 alone across four classification models (p = 3.224 × 10−9). Further, in our cohort, the four-protein biomarker panel demonstrated a higher sensitivity (median of 76\%), specificity (median of 98\%), PPV (median of 91.5\%), and NPV (median of 92\%), compared to CA-125 alone. The performance of the four-protein biomarker remained better than CA-125 alone even in experiments comparing early stage (Stage I and Stage II) ovarian cancer to healthy controls. Conclusions: Combining MIF, OPN, PROL, and CA-125 can better differentiate ovarian cancer from healthy controls compared to CA-125 alone.}},

	abstract = {{The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has triggered an ongoing global pandemic of the severe pneumonia-like disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. The development of a vaccine is likely to take at least 12--18 months, and the typical timeline for approval of a new antiviral therapeutic agent can exceed 10 years. Thus, repurposing of known drugs could substantially accelerate the deployment of new therapies for COVID-19. Here we profiled a library of drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small molecules to identify candidate therapeutic drugs for COVID-19. We report the identification of 100 molecules that inhibit viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, including 21 drugs that exhibit dose--response relationships. Of these, thirteen were found to harbour effective concentrations commensurate with probable achievable therapeutic doses in patients, including the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod2--4 and the cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825 and ONO 5334. Notably, MDL-28170, ONO 5334 and apilimod were found to antagonize viral replication in human pneumocyte-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and apilimod also demonstrated antiviral efficacy in a primary human lung explant model. Since most of the molecules identified in this study have already advanced into the clinic, their known pharmacological and human safety profiles will enable accelerated preclinical and clinical evaluation of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. A screen of the ReFRAME library of approximately 12,000 known drugs for antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) identified several candidate compounds with suitable activities and pharmacological profiles, which could potentially expedite the deployment of therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).}},

However, clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another viral target organ. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes. In human small intestinal organoids (hSIOs), enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by confocal- and electron-microscopy. Consequently, significant titers of infectious viral particles were detected. mRNA expression analysis revealed strong induction of a generic viral response program. Hence, intestinal epithelium supports SARS-CoV-2 replication, and hSIOs serve as an experimental model for coronavirus infection and biology.}},

	abstract = {{Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNASeq) has become a powerful technique for measuring the transcriptome of individual cells. Unlike the bulk measurements that average the gene expressions over the individual cells, gene measurements at individual cells can be used to study several different tissues and organs at different stages. Identifying the cell types present in the sample from the single cell transcriptome data is a common goal in many single-cell experiments. Several methods have been developed to do this. However, correctly identifying the true cell types remains a challenge. We present a framework that addresses this problem. Our hypothesis is that the meaningful characteristics of the data will remain despite small perturbations of data. We validate the performance of the proposed method on eight publicly available scRNA-seq datasets with known cell types as well as five simulation datasets with different degrees of the cluster separability. We compare the proposed method with five other existing methods: RaceID, SNN-Cliq, SINCERA, SEURAT, and SC3. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods.}},

Because of its recent emergence, there is a paucity of information regarding viral behavior and host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we offer an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other respiratory viruses. Cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response. This response is defined by low levels of type I and III interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of IL-6. We propose that reduced innate antiviral defenses coupled with exuberant inflammatory cytokine production are the defining and driving features of COVID-19.}},

@article{SaltonMP:2020,
	abstract = {{Background In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, progression to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. Methods We conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results Findings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95\% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 plus-or-minus sign 9.0 vs. 17.5 plus-or-minus sign 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). Conclusion In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71\%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Clinical Trial NCT04323592 \#\#\# Clinical Protocols \#\#\# Funding Statement This material is the result of work supported with the resources and use of facilities at the University Hospital of Trieste and Memphis VA Medical Center.

@article{Blanco-Melo2020.03.24.004655,
	abstract = {One of the greatest threats to humanity is the emergence of a pandemic virus. Among those with the greatest potential for such an event include influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of COVID-19.},

@article{Lapointe2004gene,
	abstract = {Prostate cancer, a leading cause of cancer death, displays a broad range of clinical behavior from relatively indolent to aggressive metastatic disease. To explore potential molecular variation underlying this clinical heterogeneity, we profiled gene expression in 62 primary prostate tumors, as well as 41 normal prostate specimens and nine lymph node metastases, using cDNA microarrays containing {\^a}26,000 genes. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering readily distinguished tumors from normal samples, and further identified three subclasses of prostate tumors based on distinct patterns of gene expression. High-grade and advanced stage tumors, as well as tumors associated with recurrence, were disproportionately represented among two of the three subtypes, one of which also included most lymph node metastases. To further characterize the clinical relevance of tumor subtypes, we evaluated as surrogate markers two genes differentially expressed among tumor subgroups by using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays representing an independent set of 225 prostate tumors. Positive staining for MUC1, a gene highly expressed in the subgroups with ``aggressive'' clinicopathological features, was associated with an elevated risk of recurrence (P = 0.003), whereas strong staining for AZGP1, a gene highly expressed in the other subgroup, was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence (P = 0.0008). In multivariate analysis, MUC1 and AZGP1 staining were strong predictors of tumor recurrence independent of tumor grade, stage, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels. Our results suggest that prostate tumors can be usefully classified according to their gene expression patterns, and these tumor subtypes may provide a basis for improved prognostication and treatment stratification.},

	abstract = {We describe here the use of nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}), an algorithm based on decomposition by parts that can reduce the dimension of expression data from thousands of genes to a handful of metagenes. Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, {NMF} is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of {NMF} to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. {NMF} appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

@article{Reiner2003identifying,
	abstract = {Motivation: DNA microarrays have recently been used for the purpose 
	of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and 
	identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. The probability 
	that a false identification (type I error) is committed can increase sharply
	when the number of tested genes gets large. Correlation between the test 
	statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the 
	measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the 
	problem. In this paper we address this very large multiplicity problem by 
	adopting the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling approach. In order to 
	address the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based FDR 
	controlling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution, 
	and compare their performance to that of the na{\"\i}ve application of the 
	linear step-up procedure in Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The procedures
	are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance is 
	examined relative to their ease of implementation.Results: Comparative simulation analysis shows that all four FDR 
	controlling procedures control the FDR at the desired level, and retain 
	substantially more power then the family-wise error rate controlling 
	procedures. In terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution 
	of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over the 
	na{\"\i}ve one. The highest power is achieved, at the expense of a more

In the second part we discuss auxiliary variable methods for inference in Bayesian logistic regression, including covariate set uncertainty. Finally, we show how the logistic method is easily extended to multinomial regression models. All of the algorithms are fully automatic with no user set parameters and no necessary {Metropolis-Hastings} accept/reject steps.},

@article{jauhiainen2012transcriptional,
	abstract = {With the growing availability of omics data generated to describe different cells and tissues, the modeling and interpretation of such data has become increasingly important. Pathways are sets of reactions involving genes, metabolites, and proteins highlighting functional modules in the cell. Therefore, to discover activated or perturbed pathways when comparing two conditions, for example two different tissues, it is beneficial to use several types of omics data. We present a model that integrates transcriptomic and metabolomic data in order to make an informed pathway-level decision. Since metabolites can be seen as end-points of perturbations happening at the gene level, the gene expression data constitute the explanatory variables in a sparse regression model for the metabolite data. Sophisticated model selection procedures are developed to determine an appropriate model. We demonstrate that the transcript profiles can be used to informatively explain the metabolite data from cancer cell lines. Simulation studies further show that the proposed model offers a better performance in identifying active pathways than, for example, enrichment methods performed separately on the transcript and metabolite data.},

@article{liu2008estimation,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Growing interest on biological pathways has called for new statistical methods for modeling and testing a genetic pathway effect on a health outcome. The fact that genes within a pathway tend to interact with each other and relate to the outcome in a complicated way makes nonparametric methods more desirable. The kernel machine method provides a convenient, powerful and unified method for multi-dimensional parametric and nonparametric modeling of the pathway effect.RESULTS:In this paper we propose a logistic kernel machine regression model for binary outcomes. This model relates the disease risk to covariates parametrically, and to genes within a genetic pathway parametrically or nonparametrically using kernel machines. The nonparametric genetic pathway effect allows for possible interactions among the genes within the same pathway and a complicated relationship of the genetic pathway and the outcome. We show that kernel machine estimation of the model components can be formulated using a logistic mixed model. Estimation hence can proceed within a mixed model framework using standard statistical software. A score test based on a Gaussian process approximation is developed to test for the genetic pathway effect. The methods are illustrated using a prostate cancer data set and evaluated using simulations. An extension to continuous and discrete outcomes using generalized kernel machine models and its connection with generalized linear mixed models is discussed.CONCLUSION:Logistic kernel machine regression and its extension generalized kernel machine regression provide a novel and flexible statistical tool for modeling pathway effects on discrete and continuous outcomes. Their close connection to mixed models and attractive performance make them have promising wide applications in bioinformatics and other biomedical areas.},

	RESULTS: The affy package is an R package of functions and classes for the analysis of oligonucleotide arrays manufactured by Affymetrix. The package is currently in its second release, affy provides the user with extreme flexibility when carrying out an analysis and make it possible to access and manipulate probe intensity data. In this paper, we present the main classes and functions in the package and demonstrate how they can be used to process probe-level data. We also demonstrate the importance of probe-level analysis when using the Affymetrix GeneChip platform.},

	abstract = {{Results from our laboratory have suggested a pathway involving angiotensin
	II type I (AT(1)) receptors and vascular endothelial growth factor
	(VEGF) in angiogenesis induced by electrical stimulation. The present
	study investigated if similar mechanisms underlie the angiogenesis
	induced by short-term exercise training. Seven days before training
	and throughout the training period, male Sprague-Dawley rats received
	either captopril or losartan in their drinking water. Rats underwent
	a 3-day treadmill training protocol. The tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius
	muscles were harvested under anesthesia and lightly fixed in formalin
	(vessel density) or frozen in liquid nitrogen (VEGF expression).
	In controls, treadmill training resulted in a significant increase
	in vessel density in all muscles studied. However, the angiogenesis
	induced by exercise was completely blocked by either losartan or
	captopril. Western blot analysis showed that VEGF expression was
	increased in the exercised control group, and both losartan and captopril
	blocked this increase. The role of VEGF was directly confirmed using
	a VEGF-neutralizing antibody. These results confirm the role of angiotensin
	II and VEGF in angiogenesis induced by exercise.}},

	abstract = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise
	comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two
	groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and
	involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the
	subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed
	by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images
	and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical
	tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two
	groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made
	using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes
	the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting
	gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide
	evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including
	the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the
	statistical distribution of the data.},

	abstract = {We describe a comprehensive framework for performing rapid and automatic
	nonlabel-based nonlinear spatial normalizations. The approach adopted
	minimizes the residual squared difference between an image and a
	template of the same modality. In order to reduce the number of parameters
	to be fitted, the nonlinear warps are described by a linear combination
	of low spatial frequency basis functions. The objective is to determine
	the optimum coefficients for each of the bases by minimizing the
	sum of squared differences between the image and template, while
	simultaneously maximizing the smoothness of the transformation using
	a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. Most MAP approaches assume
	that the variance associated with each voxel is already known and
	that there is no covariance between neighboring voxels. The approach
	described here attempts to estimate this variance from the data,
	and also corrects for the correlations between neighboring voxels.
	This makes the same approach suitable for the spatial normalization
	of both high-quality magnetic resonance images, and low-resolution
	noisy positron emission tomography images. A fast algorithm has been
	developed that utilizes Taylor's theorem and the separable nature
	of the basis functions, meaning that most of the nonlinear spatial
	variability between images can be automatically corrected within
	a few minutes.},

	is able to use computerized tomographic data to automatically locate,
	measure, and describe anatomical structures of interest with accuracy
	and consistency. Input to the system consists of any digitized radiographic
	data. Computer assisted tomographic (CAT) scans of the head were
	used in this first implementation. Using these data and a predefined
	atlas picture representing an idealized view of the average normal
	image, an individualized atlas was created. From the individualized
	atlas, structure size, density, location displacement, and distortion
	may be calculated. The individualized atlas created using high resolution
	data, such as the CAT scan, may then be directly superimposed on
	pictures obtained using lower resolution modalities, such as positron
	emission tomographic scan images. This allows the precise location
	of structures poorly visualized by the secondary imaging modality.
	This system is capable of using either two- or three-dimensional
	data.},

	Information (NCBI) is the largest fully public repository for high-throughput

	has a flexible and open design that allows the submission, storage
	and retrieval of many data types. These data include microarray-based
	experiments measuring the abundance of mRNA, genomic DNA and protein
	molecules, as well as non-array-based technologies such as serial
	analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and mass spectrometry proteomic
	technology. GEO currently holds over 30,000 submissions representing
	approximately half a billion individual molecular abundance measurements,
	for over 100 organisms. Here, we describe recent database developments
	that facilitate effective mining and visualization of these data.
	Features are provided to examine data from both experiment- and gene-centric
	perspectives using user-friendly Web-based interfaces accessible
	to those without computational or microarray-related analytical expertise.

	cell signalling. The N-terminus of FAK is thought to function as
	a docking site for a number of proteins, including the Src-family
	tyrosine kinases. In the present study, we disrupted FAK signalling
	by expressing the N-terminal domain of FAK (FAK-NT) in human breast
	carcinoma cells, BT474 and MCF-7 lines, and non-malignant epithelial
	cells, MCF-10A line. Expression of FAK-NT led to rounding, detachment
	and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Apoptosis was accompanied
	by dephosphorylation of FAK Tyr(397), degradation of the endogenous
	FAK protein and activation of caspase-3. Over-expression of FAK rescued
	FAK-NT-mediated cellular rounding. Expression of FAK-NT in non-malignant
	breast epithelial cells did not lead to rounding, loss of FAK phosphorylation
	or apoptosis. Thus FAK-NT contributes to cellular adhesion and survival
	pathways in breast cancer cells which are not required for survival
	in non-malignant breast epithelial cells.},

	data. The novel feature is to unify the tasks of estimating normalization
	coefficients and identifying control gene set. Unification is realized
	by constructing a window function over the scatter plot defining
	the subset of constantly expressed genes and by affecting optimization
	using an iterative procedure. The structure of window function gates
	contributions to the control gene set used to estimate normalization
	coefficients. This window measures the consistency of the matched
	neighborhoods in the scatter plot and provides a means of rejecting
	control gene outliers. The recovery of normalizational regression
	and control gene selection are interleaved and are realized by applying
	coupled operations to the mean square error function. In this way,
	the two processes bootstrap one another. We evaluate the technique
	on real microarray data from breast cancer cell lines and complement
	the experiment with a data cluster visualization study.},

	abstract = {Microarray analysis has become a widely used tool for the generation
	of gene expression data on a genomic scale. Although many significant
	results have been derived from microarray studies, one limitation
	has been the lack of standards for presenting and exchanging such
	data. Here we present a proposal, the Minimum Information About a
	Microarray Experiment (MIAME), that describes the minimum information
	required to ensure that microarray data can be easily interpreted
	and that results derived from its analysis can be independently verified.
	The ultimate goal of this work is to establish a standard for recording
	and reporting microarray-based gene expression data, which will in
	turn facilitate the establishment of databases and public repositories
	and enable the development of data analysis tools. With respect to
	MIAME, we concentrate on defining the content and structure of the
	necessary information rather than the technical format for capturing
	it.},

@article{Breslin:2005,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Signal transduction pathways convey information from the
	outside of the cell to transcription factors, which in turn regulate
	gene expression. Our objective is to analyze tumor gene expression
	data from microarrays in the context of such pathways. RESULTS: We
	use pathways compiled from the TRANSPATH/TRANSFAC databases and the
	literature, and three publicly available cancer microarray data sets.
	Variation in pathway activity, across the samples, is gauged by the
	degree of correlation between downstream targets of a pathway. Two
	correlation scores are applied; one considers all pairs of downstream
	targets, and the other considers only pairs without common transcription
	factors. Several pathways are found to be differentially active in
	the data sets using these scores. Moreover, we devise a score for
	pathway activity in individual samples, based on the average expression
	value of the downstream targets. Statistical significance is assigned
	to the scores using permutation of genes as null model. Hence, for
	individual samples, the status of a pathway is given as a sign, +
	or -, and a p-value. This approach defines a projection of high-dimensional
	gene expression data onto low-dimensional pathway activity scores.
	For each dataset and many pathways we find a much larger number of
	significant samples than expected by chance. Finally, we find that
	several sample-wise pathway activities are significantly associated

	abstract = {We have evaluated the performance characteristics of three quantitative
	gene expression technologies and correlated their expression measurements
	to those of five commercial microarray platforms, based on the MicroArray
	Quality Control (MAQC) data set. The limit of detection, assay range,
	precision, accuracy and fold-change correlations were assessed for
	997 TaqMan Gene Expression Assays, 205 Standardized RT (Sta)RT-PCR
	assays and 244 QuantiGene assays. TaqMan is a registered trademark
	of Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. We observed high correlation between
	quantitative gene expression values and microarray platform results
	and found few discordant measurements among all platforms. The main
	cause of variability was differences in probe sequence and thus target
	location. A second source of variability was the limited and variable
	sensitivity of the different microarray platforms for detecting weakly
	expressed genes, which affected interplatform and intersite reproducibility
	of differentially expressed genes. From this analysis, we conclude
	that the MAQC microarray data set has been validated by alternative
	quantitative gene expression platforms thus supporting the use of
	microarray platforms for the quantitative characterization of gene
	expression.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: High density oligonucleotide arrays are usually annotated
	in a one-to-one fashion, with each probeset assigned to one gene.
	However, in reality, subsets of oligonucleotides in a probeset may
	match sequences within more than one gene, potentially leading to
	misinterpretations. Moreover, a gene is often represented by more
	than one probeset, and analyzing probe matches at the mRNA level
	can help one deduce whether these probesets are derived from the
	same or different splice variants. RESULTS: The GeneAnnot system
	comprehensively documents the many-to-many relationship between oligonucleotide
	array probesets and annotated genes in GeneCards. It performs pairwise
	alignments between the probe sequences and gene transcripts, and
	assigns sensitivity and specificity scores to each probeset/gene
	pair. AVAILABILITY: http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneannot/ SUPPLEMENTARY

	abstract = {In an effort to identify novel candidate regulators of adipogenesis,
	gene profiling of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was analyzed
	using a novel algorithm. We report here the characterization of xanthine
	oxidoreductase (XOR) as a novel regulator of adipogenesis. XOR lies
	downstream of C/EBPbeta and upstream of PPARgamma, in the cascade
	of factors that control adipogenesis, and it regulates PPARgamma
	activity. In vitro, knockdown of XOR inhibits adipogenesis and PPARgamma
	activity while constitutive overexpression increases activity of
	the PPARgamma receptor in both adipocytes and preadipocytes. In vivo,
	XOR -/- mice demonstrate 50\% reduction in adipose mass versus wild-type
	littermates while obese ob/ob mice exhibit increased concentrations
	of XOR mRNA and urate in the adipose tissue. We propose that XOR
	is a novel regulator of adipogenesis and of PPARgamma activity and
	essential for the regulation of fat accretion. Our results identify
	XOR as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic abnormalities
	beyond hyperuricemia.},

	abstract = {From over 100 children studied with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose
	and positron emission tomography we selected 29 children (aged 5
	days to 15.1 years) who had suffered transient neurological events
	not significantly affecting normal neurodevelopment. These 29 children
	were reasonably representative of normal children and provided an
	otherwise unobtainable population in which to study developmental
	changes in local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (lCMRGlc).
	In infants less than 5 weeks old lCMRGlc was highest in sensorimotor
	cortex, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellar vermis. By 3 months,
	lCMRGlc had increased in parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices;
	basal ganglia; and cerebellar cortex. Frontal and dorsolateral occipital
	cortical regions displayed a maturational rise in lCMRGlc by approximately
	6 to 8 months. Absolute values of lCMRGlc for various grey matter
	regions were low at birth (13 to 25 mumol/min/100 gm), and rapidly
	rose to reach adult values (19 to 33 mumol/min/100 gm) by 2 years.
	lCMRGlc continued to rise until, by 3 to 4 years, it reached values
	of 49 to 65 mumol/min/100 gm in most regions. These high rates were
	maintained until approximately 9 years, when they began to decline,
	and reached adult rates again by the latter part of the second decade.
	The highest increases of lCMRGlc over adult values occurred in cerebral
	cortical structures; lesser increases were seen in subcortical structures
	and in the cerebellum. This time course of lCMRGlc changes matches
	that describing the process of initial overproduction and subsequent
	elimination of excessive neurons, synapses, and dendritic spines
	known to occur in the developing brain. The determination of changing
	metabolic patterns accompanying normal brain development is a necessary
	prelude to the study of abnormal brain development with positron
	emission tomography.},

@article{Collins:1994,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In both diagnostic and research applications, the interpretation
	of MR images of the human brain is facilitated when different data
	sets can be compared by visual inspection of equivalent anatomical
	planes. Quantitative analysis with predefined atlas templates often
	requires the initial alignment of atlas and image planes. Unfortunately,
	the axial planes acquired during separate scanning sessions are often
	different in their relative position and orientation, and these slices
	are not coplanar with those in the atlas. We have developed a completely
	automatic method to register a given volumetric data set with Talairach
	stereotaxic coordinate system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The registration
	method is based on multi-scale, three-dimensional (3D) cross-correlation
	with an average (n > 300) MR brain image volume aligned with the
	Talariach stereotaxic space. Once the data set is re-sampled by the
	transformation recovered by the algorithm, atlas slices can be directly
	superimposed on the corresponding slices of the re-sampled volume.
	the use of such a standardized space also allows the direct comparison,
	voxel to voxel, of two or more data sets brought into stereotaxic
	space. RESULTS: With use of a two-tailed Student t test for paired
	samples, there was no significant difference in the transformation
	parameters recovered by the automatic algorithm when compared with
	two manual landmark-based methods (p > 0.1 for all parameters except
	y-scale, where p > 0.05). Using root-mean-square difference between
	normalized voxel intensities as an unbiased measure of registration,
	we show that when estimated and averaged over 60 volumetric MR images
	in standard space, this measure was 30\% lower for the automatic
	technique than the manual method, indicating better registrations.
	Likewise, the automatic method showed a 57\% reduction in standard
	deviation, implying a more stable technique. The algorithm is able
	to recover the transformation even when data are missing from the
	top or bottom of the volume. CONCLUSION: We present a fully automatic
	registration method to map volumetric data into stereotaxic space
	that yields results comparable with those of manually based techniques.
	The method requires no manual identification of points or contours
	and therefore does not suffer the drawbacks involved in user intervention
	such as reproducibility and interobserver variability.},

	electrodes were part of the presurgical evaluation in 22 patients.
	Statistical analysis of 18/FDG-PET was performed to compare cerebral
	utilization of glucose to that of normal age matched controls. The
	findings of CT, MRI, and quantitative analysis of PET are compared
	with those of ictal Depth. EEG. A positive correlation between CT
	and Depth. EEG was obtained in 23\% of the patients and between MRI
	and Depth. EEG. in 50\%. For both imaging techniques a negative correlation
	was found in 5\%. Regional abnormalities were found with quantified
	PET in 95\% of the patients and were concordant with Depth. EEG.
	for side of onset in 77\% of the patients and for lobe of onset in
	59\%. A possibly false localising PET result for lobe of onset was
	obtained in 8 patients (36\%). Limitations of PET were most apparent
	in patients with regional mesiolimbic or bilateral seizure onset.
	A favourable outcome of surgery was associated usually with positive
	convergence of both methods. PET may be a valuable contribution to
	the research and management of partial complex epilepsy, but at present
	cannot be considered a reliable alternative to invasive EEG methods
	in patients without clear unilateral focus localization on surface
	EEG.},

	abstract = {Frequently, data in scientific computing is in its abstract form a
	finite point set in space, and it is sometimes useful or required
	to compute what one might call the ''shape'' of the set. For that
	purpose, this article introduces the formal notion of the family
	of alpha-shapes of a finite point set in R3. Each shape is a well-defined
	polytope, derived from the Delaunay triangulation of the point set,
	with a parameter alpha is-an-element-of R controlling the desired
	level of detail. An algorithm is presented that constructs the entire
	family of shapes for a given set of size n in time O(n2), worst case.
	A robust implementation of the algorithm is discussed, and several
	applications in the area of scientific computing are mentioned.},

@article{Engel:1990,
	abstract = {One hundred fifty-three patients with medically refractory partial
	epilepsy underwent chronic stereotactic depth-electrode EEG (SEEG)
	evaluations after being studied by positron emission tomography (PET)
	with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and scalp-sphenoidal EEG telemetry.
	We carried out retrospective standardized reviews of local cerebral
	metabolism and scalp-sphenoidal ictal onsets to determine when SEEG
	recordings revealed additional useful information. FDG-PET localization
	was misleading in only 3 patients with temporal lobe SEEG ictal onsets
	for whom extratemporal or contralateral hypometabolism could be attributed
	to obvious nonepileptic structural defects. Two patients with predominantly
	temporal hypometabolism may have had frontal epileptogenic regions,
	but ultimate localization remains uncertain. Scalp-sphenoidal ictal
	onsets were misleading in 5 patients. For 37 patients with congruent
	focal scalp-sphenoidal ictal onsets and temporal hypometabolic zones,
	SEEG recordings never demonstrated extratemporal or contralateral
	epileptogenic regions; however, 3 of these patients had nondiagnostic
	SEEG evaluations. The results of subsequent subdural grid recordings
	indicated that at least 1 of these patients may have been denied
	beneficial surgery as a result of an equivocal SEEG evaluation. Weighing
	risks and benefits, it is concluded that anterior temporal lobectomy
	is justified without chronic intracranial recording when specific
	criteria for focal scalp-sphenoidal ictal EEG onsets are met, localized
	hypometabolism predominantly involves the same temporal lobe, and
	no other conflicting information has been obtained from additional
	tests of focal functional deficit, structural imaging, or seizure
	semiology.},

@article{Fabel:2003,
	abstract = {{Declining learning and memory function is associated with the attenuation
	of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. As in humans, chronic stress or
	depression in animals is accompanied by hippocampal dysfunction,
	and neurogenesis is correspondingly down regulated, in part, by the
	activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as well as glutamatergic
	and serotonergic networks. Antidepressants can reverse this effect
	over time but one of the most clinically effective moderators of
	stress or depression and robust stimulators of neurogenesis is simple
	voluntary physical exercise such as running. Curiously, running also
	elevates circulating stress hormone levels yet neurogenesis is doubled
	in running animals. In evaluating the signalling that running provides
	to the central nervous system in mice, we have found that peripheral
	vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is necessary for the effects
	of running on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Peripheral blockade
	of VEGF abolished running-induced neurogenesis but had no detectable
	effect on baseline neurogenesis in non-running animals. These data
	suggest that VEGF is an important element of a `somatic regulator'
	of adult neurogenesis and that these somatic signalling networks
	can function independently of the central regulatory networks that
	are typically considered in the context of hippocampal neurogenesis.}},

	Various definitions of generalization error are considered, and two
	such definitions are employed in deriving generic learning curves
	and generalization properties, both with and without a weight decay
	term. The generalization error is shown analytically to be related
	to the evidence and, via the evidence, to the prediction error and
	free energy. The generalization behavior is explored; the generic
	learning curve is found to be inversely proportional to the number
	of training pairs presented. Optimization of training is considered
	by minimizing the generalization error with respect to the free parameters
	of the training algorithms. Finally, the effect of the joint activations
	between hidden-layer units is examined and shown to speed training.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns the spatial and intensity transformations that
	may one image onto another. We present a general technique that facilitates
	nonlinear spatial (stereotactic) normalization and image realignment.
	This technique minimizes the sum of squares between two images following
	nonlinear spatial deformations and transformations of the voxel (intensity)
	values. The spatial and intensity transformations are obtained simultaneously,
	and explicitly, using a least squares solution and a series of linearising
	devices. The approach is completely noninteractive (automatic), nonlinear,
	and noniterative. It can be applied in any number of dimensions.
	Various applications are considered, including the realignment of
	functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) time-series, the linear
	(affine) and nonlinear spatial normalization of positron emission
	tomography (PET) and structural MRI images, the coregistration of
	PET to structural MRI, and, implicitly, the conjoining of PET and
	MRI to obtain high resolution functional images. (C) 1996 Wiley Liss,

	abstract = {Statistical parametric maps are spatially extended statistical processes
	that are used to test hypotheses about regionally specific effects
	in neuroimaging data. The most established sorts of statistical parametric
	maps (e.g., Friston et al. [1991]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 11:690-699;
	Worsley et al. [1992]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 12:900-918) are based
	on linear models, for example ANCOVA, correlation coefficients and
	t tests. In the sense that these examples are all special cases of
	the general linear model it should be possible to implement them
	(and many others) within a unified framework. We present here a general
	approach that accomodates most forms of experimental layout and ensuing
	analysis (designed experiments with fixed effects for factors, covariates
	and interaction of factors). This approach brings together two well
	established bodies of theory (the general linear model and the theory
	of Gaussian fields) to provide a complete and simple framework for
	the analysis of imaging data.The importance of this framework is
	twofold: (i) Conceptual and mathematical simplicity, in that the
	same small number of operational equations is used irrespective of
	the complexity of the experiment or nature of the statistical model
	and (ii) the generality of the framework provides for great latitude
	in experimental design and analysis. {\copyright} 1995 Wiley-Liss,

@article{Fukushima:1980,
	abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition
	is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning
	without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus
	patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes
	without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname
	"neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network
	has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous
	system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input
	layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a
	number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers
	of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists
	of "S-cells", which show characteristics similar to simple cells
	or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists
	of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex
	cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are
	modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning:
	We do not need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization,
	and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly
	to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated
	on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of
	stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an
	output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely,
	this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus
	pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds
	to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of
	the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all.
	Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of
	the stimulus pattern.},

@article{Giedd:1996,
	abstract = {Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 104 healthy children and
	adolescents, age 4-18, showed significant effects of age and gender
	on brain morphometry. Males had larger cerebral (9\%) and cerebellar
	(8\%) volumes (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.008, respectively), which remained
	significant even after correction for height and weight. After adjusting
	for cerebral size, the putamen and globus pallidus remained larger
	in males, while relative caudate size was larger in females. Neither
	cerebral nor cerebellar volume changed significantly across this
	age range. Lateral ventricular volume increased significantly in
	males (trend for females), with males showing an increase in slope
	after age 11. In males only, caudate and putamen decrease with age
	(P = 0.007 and 0.05, respectively). The left lateral ventricles and
	putamen were significantly greater than the right (P = 0.01 and 0.001,
	respectively). In contrast, the cerebral hemispheres and caudate
	showed a highly consistent right-greater-than-left asymmetry (P <
	0.0001 for both). All volumes demonstrated a high degree of variability.
	These findings highlight gender-specific maturational changes of
	the developing brain and the need for large gender-matched samples
	in pediatric neuropsychiatric studies.},

@article{Golubovskaya:2002,
	abstract = {The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and epidermal growth factor receptor
	(EGFR) are protein-tyrosine kinases that are overexpressed and activated
	in human breast cancer. To determine the role of EGFR and FAK survival
	signaling in breast cancer, EGFR was stably overexpressed in BT474
	breast cancer cells, and each signaling pathway was specifically
	targeted for inhibition. FAK and EGFR constitutively co-immunoprecipitated
	in EGFR-overexpressing BT474 cells. In low EGFR-expressing BT474-pcDNA3
	vector control cells, inhibition of FAK by the FAK C-terminal domain
	caused detachment and apoptosis via pathways involving activation
	of caspase-3 and -8, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and
	caspase-3-dependent degradation of AKT. This apoptosis could be rescued
	by the dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain, indicating
	involvement of the death receptor pathway. EGFR overexpression did
	not inhibit detachment induced by the FAK C-terminal domain, but
	did suppress apoptosis, activating AKT and ERK1/2 survival pathways
	and inhibiting cleavage of FAK, caspase-3 and -8, and poly(ADP-ribose)
	polymerase. Furthermore, this protective effect of EGFR signaling
	was reversed by EGFR kinase inhibition with AG1478. In addition,
	inhibition of FAK and EGFR in another breast cancer cell line (BT20)
	endogenously overexpressing these kinases also induced apoptosis
	via the same mechanism as in the EGFR-overexpressing BT474 cells.
	The results of this study indicate that dual inhibition of FAK and
	EGFR signaling pathways can cooperatively enhance apoptosis in breast
	cancers.},

	Further, gene lists generated by fold-change ranking were more reproducible
	than those obtained by t-test P value or Significance Analysis of
	Microarrays. Finally, gene lists generated by fold-change ranking
	with a nonstringent P-value cutoff showed increased consistency in

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Large-scale transcription profiling of cell models and
	model organisms can identify novel molecular components involved
	in fat cell development. Detailed characterization of the sequences
	of identified gene products has not been done and global mechanisms
	have not been investigated. We evaluated the extent to which molecular
	processes can be revealed by expression profiling and functional
	annotation of genes that are differentially expressed during fat
	cell development.RESULTS:Mouse microarrays with more than 27,000
	elements were developed, and transcriptional profiles of 3T3-L1 cells
	(pre-adipocyte cells) were monitored during differentiation. In total,
	780 differentially expressed expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were
	subjected to in-depth bioinformatics analyses. The analysis of 3'-untranslated
	region sequences from 395 ESTs showed that 71\% of the differentially
	expressed genes could be regulated by microRNAs. A molecular atlas
	of fat cell development was then constructed by de novo functional
	annotation on a sequence segment/domain-wise basis of 659 protein
	sequences, and subsequent mapping onto known pathways, possible cellular
	roles, and subcellular localizations. Key enzymes in 27 out of 36
	investigated metabolic pathways were regulated at the transcriptional
	level, typically at the rate-limiting steps in these pathways. Also,
	coexpressed genes rarely shared consensus transcription-factor binding
	sites, and were typically not clustered in adjacent chromosomal regions,
	but were instead widely dispersed throughout the genome.CONCLUSIONS:Large-scale
	transcription profiling in conjunction with sophisticated bioinformatics
	analyses can provide not only a list of novel players in a particular
	setting but also a global view on biological processes and molecular
	networks.},

	abstract = {A representation and interpretation of the area under a receiver operating
	characteristic (ROC) curve obtained by the "rating" method, or by
	mathematical predictions based on patient characteristics, is presented.
	It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability
	that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked
	with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject.
	Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity
	that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon
	statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid
	closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling
	variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the
	area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size
	of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate
	of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be
	to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy
	of diagnostic techniques.},

	samples the cortex at 60 contiguous, equiangular locations, using

@article{Hassan:2006it,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE:This study was designed to identify genes differentially
	expressed in the human uterine cervix after spontaneous term labor.
	STUDY DESIGN:The transcriptome of cervical tissue was characterized
	using Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2 microarrays. Samples were collected
	from patients at term not in labor (n = 7) and after spontaneous
	labor (n = 9). Microarray statistical analysis included robust multiarray
	average, reduction of invariant probes, and permutation analysis
	for differential expression. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
	chain reaction assays of selected genes were performed on a new set
	of samples from term patients without labor (n = 10) and patients
	after spontaneous labor (n = 9). RESULTS:(1) The cervical transcriptome
	of term patients without labor was dramatically different from that
	of patients who underwent labor; (2) unique genes (n = 1192) were
	differentially expressed in the cervical tissue from patients after
	spontaneous labor, compared with that of the term patients without
	labor (false discovery rate less than 0.05, absolute fold change
	greater than 2); (3) Gene Ontology analysis indicated that multiple
	"Biological Process" categories were enriched, including "response
	to biotic stimulus," "apoptosis," "epidermis development," and "steroid
	metabolism"; (4) of major interest, genes involved in neutrophil
	chemotaxis were dramatically up-regulated in specimens from women
	after spontaneous labor; (5) real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
	chain reaction confirmed the increased expression of interleukin-8,
	interleukin-6, and vascular endothelial growth factor in patients
	after spontaneous labor; and (6) Toll-like receptor-3 and Toll-like
	receptor-5 showed decreased gene expression in patients after spontaneous
	labor. This was confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
	chain reaction. CONCLUSION:(1) Cervical dilatation in term labor
	is associated with a stereotypic gene expression pattern determined
	by microarray, which is characterized by overexpression of genes
	involved in neutrophil chemotaxis, apoptosis, extracellular matrix
	regulation, and steroid metabolism; (2) Toll-like receptor-3 and
	Toll-like receptor-5 are differentially regulated during spontaneous
	parturition at term; and (3) this study provides an unbiased and
	comprehensive description of the changes in the cervical transcriptome
	before and after spontaneous term labor.},

	abstract = {The majority of patients with complex partial seizures of unilateral
	temporal lobe origin have interictal temporal hypometabolism on [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose
	positron emission tomography (FDG PET) studies. Often, this hypometabolism
	extends to ipsilateral extratemporal sites. The use of accurately
	quantified metabolic data has been limited by the absence of an equally
	reliable method of anatomical analysis of PET images. We developed
	a standardized method for visual placement of anatomically configured
	regions of interest on FDG PET studies, which is particularly adapted
	to the widespread, asymmetric, and often severe interictal metabolic
	alterations of temporal lobe epilepsy. This method was applied by
	a single investigator, who was blind to the identity of subjects,
	to 10 normal control and 25 interictal temporal lobe epilepsy studies.
	All subjects had normal brain anatomical volumes on structural neuroimaging
	studies. The results demonstrate ipsilateral thalamic and temporal
	lobe involvement in the interictal hypometabolism of unilateral temporal
	lobe epilepsy. Ipsilateral frontal, parietal, and basal ganglial
	metabolism is also reduced, although not as markedly as is temporal
	and thalamic metabolism.},

@article{MIMAS:2006,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The high-density oligonucleotide microarray (GeneChip)
	is an important tool for molecular biological research aiming at
	large-scale detection of small nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA and
	genome-wide analysis of mRNA concentrations. Local array data management
	solutions are instrumental for efficient processing of the results
	and for subsequent uploading of data and annotations to a global
	certified data repository at the EBI (ArrayExpress) or the NCBI (GeneOmnibus).
	DESCRIPTION: To facilitate and accelerate annotation of high-throughput
	expression profiling experiments, the Microarray Information Management
	and Annotation System (MIMAS) was developed. The system is fully
	compliant with the Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment
	(MIAME) convention. MIMAS provides life scientists with a highly
	flexible and focused GeneChip data storage and annotation platform
	essential for subsequent analysis and interpretation of experimental
	results with clustering and mining tools. The system software can
	be downloaded for academic use upon request. CONCLUSION: MIMAS implements
	a novel concept for nation-wide GeneChip data management whereby
	a network of facilities is centered on one data node directly connected
	to the European certified public microarray data repository located
	at the EBI. The solution proposed may serve as a prototype approach
	to array data management between research institutes organized in
	a consortium.},

	is currently used mainly to identify groups of coregulated genes
	and to discover genes expressed differentially in distinct situations
	that could serve as drug targets. This descriptive approach. however,
	fails to extract ``distributed'' information embedded in the genomic
	regulatory network and manifested in distinct gene activation profiles.
	A model based on the formalism of boolean genetic networks in which
	cellular states are represented by attractors in a discrete dynamic
	system can serve as a conceptual framework for an integrative interpretation
	of gene expression profiles. Such a global (genome-wide) view of
	``gene function'' in the regulation of the dynamic relationship between
	proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis can provide new insights
	into cellular homeostasis and the origins of neoplasia. Implications
	for a rational approach to the identification of new drug targets
	for cancer treatment are discussed.},

	abstract = {Exposure of cells to conditions of environmental stress---including
	heat shock, oxidative stress, heavy metals, or pathologic conditions,
	such as ischemia and reperfusion, inflammation, tissue damage, infection,
	and mutant proteins associated with genetic diseases---results in
	the inducible expression of heat shock proteins that function as
	molecular chaperones or proteases. Molecular chaperones are a class
	of proteins that interact with diverse protein substrates to assist
	in their folding, with a critical role during cell stress to prevent
	the appearance of folding intermediates that lead to misfolded or
	otherwise damaged molecules. Consequently, heat shock proteins assist
	in the recovery from stress either by repairing damaged proteins
	(protein refolding) or by degrading them, thus restoring protein
	homeostasis and promoting cell survival. The events of cell stress
	and cell death are linked, such that molecular chaperones induced
	in response to stress appear to function at key regulatory points
	in the control of apoptosis. On the basis of these observations---and
	on the role of molecular chaperones in the regulation of steroid
	aporeceptors, kinases, caspases, and other protein remodeling events
	involved in chromosome replication and changes in cell structure---it
	is not surprising that the heat shock response and molecular chaperones
	have been implicated in the control of cell growth. In this review,
	we address some of the molecular and cellular events initiated by
	cell stress---the interrelationships between stress signaling, cell
	death, and oncogenesis---and chaperones as potential targets for
	cancer diagnosis and treatment.},

@article{Juhasz:2000d,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical utility of [11C]flumazenil (FMZ)
	PET to detect perilesional and remote cortical areas of abnormal
	benzodiazepine receptor binding in relation to MRI, 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose
	(FDG) PET, and electrocorticographic (ECoG) findings as well as clinical
	characteristics of the epilepsy in epileptic patients with brain
	lesion. BACKGROUND: The success of resective surgery in patients
	with medically intractable epilepsy and brain lesion depends not
	only on removal of the lesion itself but also on the reliable presurgical
	delineation of the epileptic cortex that commonly extends beyond
	it. PET could provide a noninvasive identification of such epileptogenic
	areas. METHODS: Seventeen patients underwent high resolution MRI,
	FDG and FMZ PET, and presurgical EEG evaluation, including chronic
	intracranial ECoG monitoring or intraoperative ECoG. Regional cortical
	FDG/FMZ PET abnormalities were defined on partial volume-corrected
	PET images using an objective method based on a semiautomated definition
	of areas with abnormal asymmetry. Structural lesions were defined
	on coregistered MRI. The marked PET abnormalities visualized on three-dimensional
	cortical surface were compared with each other, to the extent of
	MRI-defined lesion, as well as to ECoG findings. RESULTS: The mean
	surface extent of FMZ PET abnormalities was significantly larger
	than the corresponding structural lesions, but it was significantly
	smaller than areas of glucose hypometabolism. The size of perilesional
	FDG PET abnormalities showed a correlation with the lifetime number
	of seizures (r = 0.93, p = 0.001). The extent of perilesional FMZ
	PET abnormalities was independent of the seizure number and showed
	an excellent correspondence with spiking cortex, the resection of
	which resulted in seizure-free outcome in all but one operated patient.
	Remote FMZ PET abnormalities (n = 6) were associated with early age
	at seizure onset (p = 0.048) and appeared in ipsilateral synaptically
	connected regions from the lesion area. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional
	surface-rendered FMZ PET is able to delineate perilesional epileptic
	cortex, and it may be especially useful to localize such areas in
	patients with extensive perilesional glucose hypometabolism associated
	with a large number of seizures. Remote FMZ PET abnormalities in
	patients with early onset and long duration of epilepsy might represent
	secondary epileptogenesis, but this requires further study.},

@article{Kacser:1981,
	abstract = {The best known genes of microbes, mice and men are those that specify
	enzymes. Wild type, mutant and heterozygote for variants of such
	genes differ in the catalytic activity at the step in the enzyme
	network specified by the gene in question. The effect on the respective
	phenotypes of such changes in catalytic activity, however, is not
	defined by the enzymes change as estimated by in vitro determination
	of the activities obtained from the extracts of the three groups.
	In vivo enzymes do not act in isolation, but are kinetically linked
	to other enzymes via their substrates and products. These interactions
	modify the effect of enzyme variation on the phenotype, depending
	on the nature and quantity of the other enzymes present. An output
	of such a system, say a flux, is therefore a systemic property, and
	its response to variation at one locus must be measured in the whole
	system. This response is best described by the sensitivity coefficient,
	Z, while is defined by the fractional change in flux over the fractional
	change in enzyme activity. (formula: see text). Its magnitude determines
	the extent to which a particular enzyme "controls" a particular flux
	or phenotype and, implicitly, determines the values that the three
	phenotypes will have. There are as many sensitivity coefficients
	for a given flux as there are enzymes in the system. It can be shown
	that the sum of all such coefficients equals unity. (formula: see
	text). Since n, the number of enzymes, is large, this summation property
	results in the individual coefficients being small. The effect of
	making a large change in enzyme activity therefore usually results
	in only a negligible change in flux. A reduction to 50\% activity
	in the heterozygote, a common feature for many mutants, is therefore
	not expected to be detectable in the phenotype. The mutant would
	therefore be described as "recessive". The widespread occurrence
	of recessive mutants is thus seen to be the inevitable consequence
	of the kinetic structure of enzyme networks. The ad hoc hypothesis
	of "modifiers" selected to maximize the fitness of the heterozygote,
	as proposed by Fisher, is therefore unnecessary. It is based on the
	false general expectation of an intermediate phenotype in the heterozygote.
	Wright's analysis, substantially sound in its approach, proposed
	selection of a "safety factor" in enzyme activity. The derivation
	of the summation property explains why such safety factors are automatically
	present in almost all enzymes without selection.},

@article{Kiebel:1999,
	abstract = {The assessment of significant activations in functional imaging using
	voxel-based methods often relies on results derived from the theory
	of Gaussian random fields. These results solve the multiple comparison
	problem and assume that the spatial correlation or smoothness of
	the data is known or can be estimated. End results (i. e., P values
	associated with local maxima, clusters, or sets of clusters) critically
	depend on this assessment, which should be as exact and as reliable
	as possible. In some earlier implementations of statistical parametric
	mapping (SPM) (SPM94, SPM95) the smoothness was assessed on Gaussianized
	t-fields (Gt-f) that are not generally free of physiological signal.
	This technique has two limitations. First, the estimation is not
	stable (the variance of the estimator being far from negligible)
	and, second, physiological signal in the Gt-f will bias the estimation.
	In this paper, we describe an estimation method that overcomes these
	drawbacks. The new approach involves estimating the smoothness of
	standardized residual fields which approximates the smoothness of
	the component fields of the associated t-field. Knowing the smoothness
	of these component fields is important because it allows one to compute
	corrected P values for statistical fields other than the t-field
	or the Gt-f (e.g., the F-map) and eschews bias due to deviation from
	the null hypothesis. We validate the method on simulated data and
	demonstrate it using data from a functional MRI study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Structural analysis of cellular interaction networks contributes
	to a deeper understanding of network-wide interdependencies, causal
	relationships, and basic functional capabilities. While the structural
	analysis of metabolic networks is a well-established field, similar
	methodologies have been scarcely developed and applied to signaling
	and regulatory networks.RESULTS:We propose formalisms and methods,
	relying on adapted and partially newly introduced approaches, which
	facilitate a structural analysis of signaling and regulatory networks
	with focus on functional aspects. We use two different formalisms
	to represent and analyze interaction networks: interaction graphs
	and (logical) interaction hypergraphs. We show that, in interaction
	graphs, the determination of feedback cycles and of all the signaling
	paths between any pair of species is equivalent to the computation
	of elementary modes known from metabolic networks. Knowledge on the
	set of signaling paths and feedback loops facilitates the computation
	of intervention strategies and the classification of compounds into
	activators, inhibitors, ambivalent factors, and non-affecting factors
	with respect to a certain species. In some cases, qualitative effects
	induced by perturbations can be unambiguously predicted from the
	network scheme. Interaction graphs however, are not able to capture
	AND relationships which do frequently occur in interaction networks.
	The consequent logical concatenation of all the arcs pointing into
	a species leads to Boolean networks. For a Boolean representation
	of cellular interaction networks we propose a formalism based on
	logical (or signed) interaction hypergraphs, which facilitates in
	particular a logical steady state analysis (LSSA). LSSA enables studies
	on the logical processing of signals and the identification of optimal
	intervention points (targets) in cellular networks. LSSA also reveals
	network regions whose parametrization and initial states are crucial
	for the dynamic behavior.We have implemented these methods in our
	software tool CellNetAnalyzer (successor of FluxAnalyzer) and illustrate
	their applicability using a logical model of T-Cell receptor signaling
	providing non-intuitive results regarding feedback loops, essential
	elements, and (logical) signal processing upon different stimuli.CONCLUSION:The
	methods and formalisms we propose herein are another step towards
	the comprehensive functional analysis of cellular interaction networks.
	Their potential, shown on a realistic T-cell signaling model, makes
	them a promising tool.},

@article{Klessner:2009jq,
	abstract = {Regulation of classic cadherins plays a critical role in tissue remodeling
	during development and cancer; however, less attention has been paid
	to the importance of desmosomal cadherins. We previously showed that
	EGFR inhibition results in accumulation of the desmosomal cadherin,
	desmoglein 2 (Dsg2), at cell-cell interfaces accompanied by inhibition
	of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-dependent shedding of the Dsg2 ectodomain
	and tyrosine phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain. Here, we
	show that EGFR inhibition stabilizes Dsg2 at intercellular junctions
	by interfering with its accumulation in an internalized cytoplasmic
	pool. Furthermore, MMP inhibition and ADAM17 RNAi, blocked shedding
	and depleted internalized Dsg2, but less so E-cadherin, in highly
	invasive SCC68 cells. ADAM9 and 15 silencing also impaired Dsg2 processing,
	supporting the idea that this desmosomal cadherin can be regulated
	by multiple ADAM family members. In contrast, ADAM10 siRNA enhanced
	accumulation of a 100-kDa Dsg2 cleavage product and internalized
	pool of Dsg2. Although both MMP and EGFR inhibition increased intercellular
	adhesive strength in control cells, the response to MMP-inhibition
	was Dsg2-dependent. These data support a role for endocytic trafficking
	in regulating desmosomal cadherin turnover and function and raise
	the possibility that internalization and regulation of desmosomal
	and classic cadherin function can be uncoupled mechanistically.},

	abstract = {Understanding how the immune system in patients with cancer interacts with malignant cells is critical for the development of successful immunotherapeutic strategies. We studied peripheral blood from newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia ({AML}) to assess the impact of this disease on the patients' T cells. The absolute number of peripheral blood T cells is increased in {AML} compared with healthy controls. An increase in the absolute number of {CD}3+56+ cells was also noted. Gene expression profiling on T cells from {AML} patients compared with healthy donors demonstrated global differences in transcription suggesting aberrant T-cell activation patterns. These gene expression changes differ from those observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia ({CLL}), indicating the heterogeneous means by which different tumors evade the host immune response. However, in common with {CLL}, differentially regulated genes involved in actin cytoskeletal formation were identified, and therefore the ability of T cells from {AML} patients to form immunologic synapses was assessed. Although {AML} T cells could form conjugates with autologous blasts, their ability to form immune synapses and recruit phosphotyrosine signaling molecules to the synapse was significantly impaired. These findings identify T-cell dysfunction in {AML} that may contribute to the failure of a host immune response against leukemic blasts.},

@article{Goualher:1999,
	abstract = {Systematic mapping of the variability in cortical sulcal anatomy is
	an area of increasing interest which presents numerous methodological
	challenges. To address these issues, we have implemented sulcal extraction
	and assisted labeling (SEAL) to automatically extract the two-dimensional
	(2-D) surface ribbons that represent the median axis of cerebral
	sulci and to neuroanatomically label these entities. To encode the
	extracted three-dimensional (3-D) cortical sulcal schematic topography
	(CSST) we define a relational graph structure composed of two main
	features: vertices (representing sulci) and arcs (representing the
	relationships between sulci). Vertices contain a parametric representation
	of the surface ribbon buried within the sulcus. Points on this surface
	are expressed in stereotaxic coordinates (i.e., with respect to a
	standardized brain coordinate system). For each of these vertices,
	we store length, depth, and orientation as well as anatomical attributes
	(e.g., hemisphere, lobe, sulcus type, etc.). Each arc stores the
	3-D location of the junction between sulci as well as a list of its
	connecting sulci. Sulcal labeling is performed semiautomatically
	by selecting a sulcal entity in the CSST and selecting from a menu
	of candidate sulcus names. In order to help the user in the labeling
	task, the menu is restricted to the most likely candidates by using
	priors for the expected sulcal spatial distribution. These priors,
	i.e., sulcal probabilistic maps, were created from the spatial distribution
	of 34 sulci traced manually on 36 different subjects. Given these
	spatial probability maps, the user is provided with the likelihood
	that the selected entity belongs to a particular sulcus. The cortical
	structure representation obtained by SEAL is suitable to extract
	statistical information about both the spatial and the structural
	composition of the cerebral cortical topography. This methodology
	allows for the iterative construction of a successively more complete
	statistical models of the cerebral topography containing spatial
	distributions of the most important structures, their morphometrics,
	and their structural components.},

	abstract = {GeneLynx Mouse is a meta-database providing an extensive collection
	of hyperlinks to mouse gene-specific information in diverse databases
	available via the Internet. The GeneLynx project is based on the
	simple notion that given any gene-specific identifier (e.g., accession
	number, gene name, text, or sequence), scientists should be able
	to access a single location that provides a set of links to all the
	publicly available information pertinent to the specified gene. The
	recent climax in the mouse genome and RIKEN cDNA sequencing projects
	provided the data necessary for the development of a gene-centric
	mouse information portal based on the GeneLynx ideals. Clusters of
	RIKEN cDNA sequences were used to define the initial set of mouse
	genes. Like its human counterpart, GeneLynx Mouse is designed as
	an extensible relational database with an intuitive and user-friendly
	Web interface. Data is automatically extracted from diverse resources,
	using appropriate approaches to maximize the coverage. To promote
	cross-database interoperability, an indexing utility is provided
	to facilitate the establishment of hyperlinks in external databases.
	As a result of the integration of the human and mouse systems, GeneLynx
	now serves as a powerful comparative genomics data mining resource.

@article{Leppert:1995wm,
	abstract = {The uterine cervix is a unique organ composed predominately of the
	extracellular matrix proteins, collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans.
	During pregnancy and labor, this organ is metabolically active, which
	is rare in adult tissue. The metabolism is under reproductive hormonal
	control and is more complex than previously appreciated. Smooth muscle
	cells, which comprise 10-15\% of cervical tissue, undergo programmed
	cell death and play a role in cervical softening. Apoptosis is a
	genetically timed event and could explain the species-specific length
	of gestation. Further research in the next several years will reveal
	more completely the exciting process of cervical ripening. Only when
	this phenomenon is understood will rational therapy for preterm labor
	and post-term pregnancy with an unripe cervix be available. Specific
	defects in cervical ripening will then be diagnosed and treated.
	For example, if apoptosis is shown to play an important role in the
	process of cervical ripening, it could be inhibited. Conversely,
	it could be induced in the unripe cervix. If we would look for it,
	we would find that it is probably occurring today in the clinical
	use of cervical ripening agents. The most important contributor to
	cervical softening, however, is a rearrangement and realignment of
	the collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle cells, which occurs due
	to mechanical forces and to a rearrangement of the collagen that
	occurs as the content of glycosaminoglycans varies in the cervix
	with time. One form of dermatan sulfate, decorin, may help to separate
	the collagen fibrils and then open them up. This rearrangement also
	involves fiber shortening below the critical length for tensile strength,
	allowing for extensibility of the cervix. Because of its orientation
	in the cervix, elastin contributes to the ratchet-like mechanism
	of dilatation. Finally, the cervix undergoes change in two phases--softening,
	which involves collagen realignment, and dilatation. The proteolytic
	enzymes in the cervix degrade cross-linked, newly synthesized collagen,
	and they help activate other enzymes in a cascade. However, the predominate
	anatomic and physiologic change in ripening is the rearrangement
	of collagen.},

	abstract = {Oral estrogen administration attenuates the metabolic action of growth
	hormone (GH) in humans. To investigate the mechanism involved, we
	studied the effects of estrogen on GH signaling through Janus kinase
	(JAK)2 and the signal transducers and activators of transcription
	(STATs) in HEK293 cells stably expressing the GH receptor (293GHR),
	HuH7 (hepatoma) and T-47D (breast cancer) cells. 293GHR cells were
	transiently transfected with an estrogen receptor-alpha expression
	plasmid and luciferase reporters with binding elements for STAT3
	and STAT5 or the beta-casein promoter. GH stimulated the reporter
	activities by four- to sixfold. Cotreatment with 17beta-estradiol
	(E(2)) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the response of
	all three reporters to GH to a maximum of 49-66\% of control at 100
	nM (P < 0.05). No reduction was seen when E(2) was added 1-2 h after
	GH treatment. Similar inhibitory effects were observed in HuH7 and
	T-47D cells. E(2) suppressed GH-induced JAK2 phosphorylation, an
	effect attenuated by actinomycin D, suggesting a requirement for
	gene expression. Next, we investigated the role of the suppressors
	of cytokine signaling (SOCS) in E(2) inhibition. E(2) increased the
	mRNA abundance of SOCS-2 but not SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in HEK293 cells.
	The inhibitory effect of E(2) was absent in cells lacking SOCS-2
	but not in those lacking SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. In conclusion, estrogen
	inhibits GH signaling, an action mediated by SOCS-2. This paper provides
	evidence for regulatory interaction between a sex steroid and the
	GHJAKSTAT pathway, in which SOCS-2 plays a central mechanistic role.},

	in brown adipose tissue (BAT). This protocol describes a mouse model
	to study the activation of BAT and angiogenesis in adipose tissues
	by cold acclimation. After a 1-week exposure to 4 $\,^{\circ}$C,
	adult C57BL/6 mice show an obvious transition from subcutaneous white
	adipose tissue (WAT) into brown-like adipose tissue (BRITE). The
	BRITE phenotype persists after continuous cold exposure, and by the
	end of week 5 BRITE contains a high number of uncoupling protein-1-positive
	mitochondria, a characteristic feature of BAT. During the transition
	from WAT into BRITE, the vascular density is markedly increased owing
	to the activation of angiogenesis. In BAT, cold exposure stimulates
	thermogenesis by increasing the mitochondrial content and metabolic
	rate. BAT and the increased metabolic rate result in a lean phenotype.
	This protocol provides an outstanding opportunity to study the molecular
	mechanisms that control adipose mass.},

	Specifically, we present three algorithms for the extraction of gyri,

	line representations which can be used to describe the individual
	properties of the neocortical surface. The algorithms consist of
	a sequence of image analysis steps applied directly to the volumetric
	image data without requiring intermediate data representations such
	as surfaces or three-dimensional renderings. Previous studies have
	mostly focused on the extraction of surface representations, rather
	than line representations of cortical structures. We believe that

	this field is the high interpersonal variability of human neuroanatomy
	which makes studies across many subjects very difficult. The cortical
	folds ('sulci') often serve as landmarks that help to establish correspondences
	between subjects. In this paper, we will present a method that automatically
	detects and attributes neuroanatomical names to the cortical folds
	using image analysis methods applied to magnetic resonance data of
	human brains. We claim that the cortical folds can be subdivided
	into a number of substructures which we call sulcal basins. The concept
	of sulcal basins allows us to establish a complete parcellation of
	the cortical surface into separate regions. These regions are neuroanatomically
	meaningful and can be identified from MR data sets across many subjects.
	Sulcal basins are segmented using a region growing approach. The
	automatic labelling is achieved by a model matching technique.},

	abstract = {Successful delivery of the fetus (parturition) depends on coordinate
	interactions between the uterus and cervix. A majority (70\%) of
	mice deficient in the type 1 isozyme of steroid 5alpha-reductase
	fail to deliver their young at term and thus manifest a parturition
	defect. Using in vitro and in vivo measurements we show here that
	rhythmic contractions of the uterus occur normally in these mutant
	mice at the end of gestation. In contrast, the cervix of the mutant
	animal fails to ripen at term as judged by biomechanical, histological,
	and endocrinological assays. Impaired metabolism of progesterone
	in the cervix of the mutant mice in late gestation leads to an accumulation
	of this steroid in the tissue. We conclude that a failure of cervical
	ripening underlies the parturition defect in mice lacking steroid
	5alpha-reductase type 1 and that this enzyme normally plays an essential
	role in cervical progesterone catabolism at the end of pregnancy.},

@article{RAD:2004,
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression array technology has become increasingly
	widespread among researchers who recognize its numerous promises.
	At the same time, bench biologists and bioinformaticians have come
	to appreciate increasingly the importance of establishing a collaborative
	dialog from the onset of a study and of collecting and exchanging
	detailed information on the many experimental and computational procedures
	using a structured mechanism. This is crucial for adequate analyses
	of this kind of data. RESULTS: The RNA Abundance Database (RAD; http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/RAD)
	provides a comprehensive MIAME-supportive infrastructure for gene
	expression data management and makes extensive use of ontologies.
	Specific details on protocols, biomaterials, study designs, etc.
	are collected through a user-friendly suite of web annotation forms.
	Software has been developed to generate MAGE-ML documents to enable
	easy export of studies stored in RAD to any other database accepting
	data in this format (e.g. ArrayExpress). RAD is part of a more general
	Genomics Unified Schema (http://www.gusdb.org), which includes a
	richly annotated gene index (http://www.allgenes.org), thus providing
	a platform that integrates genomic and transcriptomic data from multiple
	organisms. This infrastructure enables a large variety of queries
	that incorporate visualization and analysis tools and have been tailored
	to serve the specific needs of projects focusing on particular organisms
	or biological systems.},

	representation of the cortical topography from a T1-weighted 3D MR

	inferred from the 3D skeleton of the object made up of the union
	of gray matter and cerebro-spinal fluid enclosed in the brain hull.
	In order to increase the robustness of the skeletonization, topological
	and regularization constraints are included in the segmentation process
	using an original method: the homotopically deformable regions. This
	method is halfway between deformable contour and Markovian segmentation
	approaches. The 3D skeleton is segmented in simple surfaces (SSs)
	constituting the ARG nodes (mainly cortical folds). The ARG relations
	are of two types: first, theSS pairs connected in the skeleton; second,
	theSS pairs delimiting a gyrus. The described algorithm has been
	developed in the frame of a project aiming at the automatic detection
	and recognition of the main cortical sulci. Indeed, the ARG is a
	synthetic representation of all the information required by the sulcus
	identification. This project will contribute to the development of

	Using a hemispheric perfusion index (mean of four 30 degrees sectors)
	ipsilateral perfusion improved in 11/19 (58\%) with bilateral improvement

@article{MARS:2005,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray analysis has become a widely used technique
	for the study of gene-expression patterns on a genomic scale. As
	more and more laboratories are adopting microarray technology, there
	is a need for powerful and easy to use microarray databases facilitating
	array fabrication, labeling, hybridization, and data analysis. The
	wealth of data generated by this high throughput approach renders
	adequate database and analysis tools crucial for the pursuit of insights
	into the transcriptomic behavior of cells. RESULTS: MARS (Microarray
	Analysis and Retrieval System) provides a comprehensive MIAME supportive
	suite for storing, retrieving, and analyzing multi color microarray
	data. The system comprises a laboratory information management system
	(LIMS), a quality control management, as well as a sophisticated
	user management system. MARS is fully integrated into an analytical
	pipeline of microarray image analysis, normalization, gene expression
	clustering, and mapping of gene expression data onto biological pathways.
	The incorporation of ontologies and the use of MAGE-ML enables an
	export of studies stored in MARS to public repositories and other
	databases accepting these documents. CONCLUSION: We have developed
	an integrated system tailored to serve the specific needs of microarray
	based research projects using a unique fusion of Web based and standalone
	applications connected to the latest J2EE application server technology.
	The presented system is freely available for academic and non-profit
	institutions. More information can be found at http://genome.tugraz.at.},

	abstract = {Wnt signaling has recently emerged as a critical pathway in lung carcinogenesis
	as already demonstrated in many cancers and particularly in colorectal
	cancer. We critically discuss in this review the individual components
	of the Wnt pathway and their role in lung cancer development. We
	propose that activation of the Wnt-mediated signal occurs in a different
	manner in lung cancer than in colorectal cancer. In lung cancer,
	mutations of APC or beta-catenin are rare and the Wnt pathway appears
	to be activated upstream of beta-catenin. We identified at least
	three mechanisms of activation: overexpression of Wnt effectors such
	as Dvl, activation of a non-canonical pathway involving JNK and repression
	of Wnt antagonists such as WIF-1. The respective relevance of each
	event and their likely relationship remain unclear. Nevertheless,
	we propose that many of the studied components of the Wnt pathway
	may serve as potential targets in the search for therapeutic agents
	and we can reasonably argue that blockade of Wnt pathway may lead
	to new treatment strategies in lung cancer.},

@article{arrayCGHbase:2005,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of the human genome sequence as well
	as the large number of physically accessible oligonucleotides, cDNA,
	and BAC clones across the entire genome has triggered and accelerated
	the use of several platforms for analysis of DNA copy number changes,
	amongst others microarray comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH).
	One of the challenges inherent to this new technology is the management
	and analysis of large numbers of data points generated in each individual
	experiment. RESULTS: We have developed arrayCGHbase, a comprehensive
	analysis platform for arrayCGH experiments consisting of a MIAME
	(Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment) supportive database
	using MySQL underlying a data mining web tool, to store, analyze,
	interpret, compare, and visualize arrayCGH results in a uniform and
	user-friendly format. Following its flexible design, arrayCGHbase
	is compatible with all existing and forthcoming arrayCGH platforms.
	Data can be exported in a multitude of formats, including BED files
	to map copy number information on the genome using the Ensembl or
	UCSC genome browser. CONCLUSION: ArrayCGHbase is a web based and
	platform independent arrayCGH data analysis tool, that allows users
	to access the analysis suite through the internet or a local intranet
	after installation on a private server. ArrayCGHbase is available
	at http://medgen.ugent.be/arrayCGHbase/.},

	abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that capillary proliferation
	in skeletal muscles, induced by a long-term increase in blood flow
	which elevates capillary shear stress. is associated with capillary
	expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Methods:
	Adult rats received prazosin in drinking water (similar to2 mg per
	day) or had extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles stimulated by
	implanted electrode, for up to 14 days. At intervals, serial frozen
	sections of EDL were stained for alkaline phosphatase to identify
	capillaries. proliferating cell unclear antigen (PCNA). and VEGF-A
	protein. Shear stress was estimated from capillary red blood cell
	velocities and diameters. measured by direct observation of epi-illuminated
	EDL. Results: Chronic stimulation and prazosin treatment both increased
	capillary: fiber ratio by similar to 40\% after 14 days. In stimulated
	muscles, the percentage of capillaries positively stained for VEGF
	increased within 3 to 4 days, while the density of PCNA-positive
	capillaries had increased 20-fold after 2 days. With prazosin. VEGF-positive
	capillaries increased after 2 and 4 days, accompanied by a threefold
	increase in PCNA. By 14 days, PCNA labeling and VEGF were still high
	in stimulated muscles but no longer different from controls with
	prazosin. After 3 to 4 days of treatment. capillary shear stress
	in resting muscle was 57\% higher than in controls as a result of
	stimulation, but 4 times higher with prazosin. Conclusions: Higher
	capillary shear stress with prazosin than with stimulation may upregulate
	VEGF expression in the early stages of treatment. Greater proliferation
	of capillaries preceding a higher proportion of VEGF-positive capillaries
	in stimulated muscles, in the presence of a modest increase in shear
	stress suggests, that angiogenesis was initiated by other factors,
	in addition to shear stress.}},

@article{Minoshima:1995,
	abstract = {To improve the diagnostic performance of PET as an aid in evaluating
	patients suspected of having Alzheimer's disease, we developed a
	fully automated method which generates comprehensive image presentations
	and objective diagnostic indices. METHODS: Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose
	PET image sets were collected from 37 patients with probable Alzheimer's
	disease (including questionable and mild dementia), 22 normal subjects
	and 5 patients with cerebrovascular disease. Following stereotactic
	anatomic standardization, metabolic activity on an individual's PET
	image set was extracted to a set of predefined surface pixels (three-dimensional
	stereotactic surface projection, 3D-SSP), which was used in the subsequent
	analysis. A normal database was created by averaging extracted datasets
	of the normal subjects. Patients' datasets were compared individually
	with the normal database by calculating a Z-score on a pixel-by-pixel
	basis and were displayed in 3D-SSP views for visual inspections.
	Diagnostic indices were then generated based on averaged Z-scores
	for the association cortices. RESULTS: Patterns and severities of
	metabolic reduction in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease
	were seen in the standard 3D-SSP views of extracted raw data and
	statistical Z-scores. When discriminating patients with probable
	Alzheimer's disease from normal subjects, diagnostic indices of the
	parietal association cortex and unilaterally averaged parietal-temporal-frontal
	cortex showed sensitivities of 95\% and 97\%, respectively, with
	a specificity of 100\%. Neither index yielded false-positive results
	for cerebrovascular disease. CONCLUSION: 3D-SSP enables quantitative
	data extraction and reliable localization of metabolic abnormalities
	by means of stereotactic coordinates. The proposed method is a promising
	approach for interpreting functional brain PET scans.},

	abstract = {SPM is a powerful technique for the comparison of functional imaging
	data sets among groups of patients. While this technique has been
	widely applied in studies of adults, it has rarely been applied to
	studies of children, due in part to the lack of validation of the
	spatial normalization procedure in children of different ages. In
	order to determine if spatial normalization of FDG PET images using
	SPM96 to an adult template can be successfully applied in children,
	we applied PET-derived transformation parameters to coregistered
	MRI images. We then compared contours of spatially normalized MRI
	images obtained from 13 children with epilepsy (ages 2-14 years,
	mean 7.6 +/- 3.9 years) with those derived from 17 adult controls
	(mean age 27.6 +/- 4.5 years). Contours of spatially normalized MRI
	image volumes derived from the pediatric group were more variable
	than those obtained from adult controls. The average deviation from
	the mean adult contour was age-dependent and decreased with age (average
	deviation (mm) = 2.22 (mm) - 0.021 (mm/year) x years, r = 0.70, P
	< 0.001). Separate SPM analyses were performed for children less
	than 6 years (N1 = 6) and for children between 6 and 14 years of
	age (N2 = 7). SPM analyses performed in both pediatric groups showed
	significant regions of hypometabolism in locations consistent with
	their epileptic foci. SPM analyses in the younger group also showed
	significant artifacts. Therefore, the error associated with spatial
	normalization of pediatric brains to an adult template in children
	less than 6 years of age precludes the application of statistical
	parametric mapping in this age group. Although the error in the spatial
	normalization procedure for children ages 6 to 14 years is higher
	than in adults, it appears that this error does not result in artifacts
	in the SPM analysis. Furthermore, in contrast our previous studies
	showing large age-related changes in the absolute glucose metabolic
	rate at puberty, the SPM analysis showed children over 6 years of
	age appear to display the same pattern of glucose utilization as
	adults. However, small differences in the pattern of glucose utilization
	which might occur during late childhood and adolescence may not have
	been detected due to the sample size.},

	epilepsy of unilateral origin; they underwent [F-18] deoxyglucose
	positron emission tomography (PET) prior to surgical resection of
	epileptic foci. A semiautomated method for assessment of asymmetries
	in the brain cortex was developed that compares activity concentrations
	in homotopic cortical areas. When these differences exceeded a predefined
	threshold, the areas with lower activity were marked and 3-dimensional
	surface rendered images were created to guide placement of intracranial
	electrodes (ECoG) followed by surgical resection. The normal amount
	of asymmetry between small (0.5-0.7 cm2) homotopic cortical regions
	was determined as 5.9 +/- 4.0\% (mean +/- SD). The false-positive
	fraction was determined for cutoff thresholds of 1 SD (10\%), 1.5
	SD (12\%), and 2 SD (15\%) outside the mean and was found to be 89,

	for correct localization of epileptogenic lobes based on the ECoG
	results were best for the 15\% threshold (80/94\%, accuracy 0.90).
	This objective PET method allows the accurate determination of cortical

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare abnormalities determined in 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose
	(FDG) and [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) PET images with intracranial EEG
	data in patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy. BACKGROUND: Although
	PET studies with FDG and FMZ are being used clinically to localize
	epileptogenic regions in patients with refractory epilepsy, the electrophysiologic
	significance of the identified PET abnormalities remains poorly understood.
	METHODS: We studied 10 patients, mostly children (4 boys, 6 girls,
	aged 2 to 19 years; mean age, 11 years), who underwent FDG and FMZ
	PET scans, intracranial EEG monitoring, and cortical resection for
	intractable epilepsy. EEG electrode positions relative to the brain
	surface were determined from MRI image volumes. Cortical areas of
	abnormal glucose metabolism or FMZ binding were determined objectively
	based on asymmetry measures derived from homotopic cortical areas
	at three asymmetry thresholds. PET data were then coregistered with
	the MRI and overlaid on the MRI surface. A receiver operating characteristics
	(ROC) analysis was performed to determine the specificity and sensitivity
	of PET-defined abnormalities against the gold standard of intracranial
	EEG data. RESULTS: FMZ PET detected at least part of the seizure
	onset zone in all subjects, whereas FDG PET failed to detect the
	seizure onset region in two of 10 patients. The area under the ROC
	curves was higher for FMZ than FDG PET for both seizure onset (p
	= 0.01) and frequent interictal spiking (p = 0.04). Both FMZ and
	FDG PET showed poor performance for detection of rapid seizure spread
	(area under the ROC curve not significantly different from 0.5).
	CONCLUSIONS: [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) PET is significantly more sensitive
	than 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET for the detection
	of cortical regions of seizure onset and frequent spiking in patients
	with extratemporal lobe epilepsy, whereas both FDG and FMZ PET show
	low sensitivity in the detection of cortical areas of rapid seizure
	spread. The application of PET, in particular FMZ PET, in guiding
	subdural electrode placement in refractory extratemporal lobe epilepsy
	will enhance coverage of the epileptogenic zone.},

	abstract = {Altered structure and regulation of the c-myc proto-oncogene have
	been associated with a variety of human tumours and derivative cell
	lines, including Burkitt's lymphoma, promyelocytic leukaemia and
	small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The N-myc gene, first detected by
	its homology to the second exon of the c-myc gene, is amplified and/or
	expressed in tumours or cell lines derived from neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma
	and SCLC. Here we describe a third myc-related gene (L-myc) cloned
	from SCLC DNA with homology to a small region of both the c-myc and
	N-myc genes. Human genomic DNA shows an EcoRI restriction fragment
	length polymorphism (RFLP) of L-myc defined by two alleles (10.0-
	and 6.6-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragments), neither associated disproportionately
	with SCLC. Mouse and hamster DNAs exhibit a 12-kb EcoRI L-myc homologue,
	which indicates conservation of the gene in mammals. Gene mapping
	studies assign L-myc to human chromosome region 1p32, a location
	distinct from that of either c-myc or N-myc but associated with cytogenetic
	abnormalities in certain human tumours. This L-myc sequence is amplified
	10-20-fold in four SCLC cell line DNAs and in one SCLC tumour specimen
	taken directly from a patient. Either the 10.0- or 6.6-kb allele
	can be amplified and in heterozygotes only one of the two alleles
	was amplified in any SCLC genome. SCLC cell lines with amplified
	L-myc sequences express L-myc-derived transcripts not seen in SCLC
	with amplified c-myc or N-myc genes. In addition, some SCLCs without
	amplification also express L-myc-related transcripts. Together, these
	findings suggest an enlarging role for myc-related genes in human
	lung cancer and provide evidence for the concept of a myc family

	abstract = {A pilot study was conducted to assess whether plasma levels of transforming
	growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) might facilitate biological subgrouping
	of postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients, and, accordingly,
	its applicability in clinical oncology. This study included 29 postmenopausal
	metastatic breast cancer patients. Plasma TGF-beta1 levels were detected
	by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Estrogen and progesterone
	receptors were assayed by radioligand binding, in accordance with
	the recommendation of the EORTC. Concentrations of 17-beta estradiol
	were determined by using ELISA-microwell method (DIALAB). Overall
	survival was followed for 24 months for each individual patient.
	Stratification of the patients by ER/PR status showed that 14 patients
	with estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative carcinomas
	displayed a statistically significant increase in plasma TGF-beta1
	levels when compared to plasma TGF-beta1 levels of 6 patients with
	ER-positive, PR-positive carcinomas (P=0.04). In this study, 7 out
	of 14 patients status had no plasma TGF-beta1 values overlapping
	with patients having positive receptors' status. The TGF-beta1 cut-off
	value was defined as the highest plasma TGF-beta1 level of ER-positive,
	PR-positive patients: 3.28 ng/ml. This plasma TGF-beta1 cut-off value
	defined low-risk subgroup of 19 patients (< or = 3.28 ng/ml) and
	high-risk subgroup of 10 patients (> 3.28 ng/ml) (P=0.047). Plasma
	TGF-beta1-related survival was independent of the classical prognostic
	factors of metastatic breast cancer. Accordingly, a clinical significance
	of elevated plasma TGF-beta1 levels may be suggested.},

	abstract = {Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is up-regulated in a variety of cancers,
	including breast cancer, in association with poor disease prognosis.
	In the present study, we examined the role of FAK in the control
	of anticancer drug-induced apoptosis of mammary adenocarcinoma MTLn3
	cells. Doxorubicin caused the formation of well defined focal adhesions
	and stress fibers early after treatment, which was later followed
	by their loss in association with the onset of apoptosis. Phosphorylation
	of FAK on tyrosine 397 decreased only during the onset of doxorubicin-induced
	apoptosis in a Bcl-2 and caspase-independent manner. Doxorubicin
	also caused an early activation of protein kinase B (PKB). Expression
	of the dominant-negative acting focal adhesion kinase-related nonkinase
	(FRNK) sensitized MTLn3 cells to apoptosis caused by doxorubicin.
	FRNK inhibited the doxorubicin-induced activation of PKB. In addition,
	inhibition of phosphatidylinositide-3 (PI-3) kinase with wortmannin
	inhibited the activation of PKB by doxorubicin. Both wortmannin and
	transient overexpression of the dual lipid/protein phosphatase and
	tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 enhanced doxorubicin-induced
	cell death. Altogether, these data fit with a model wherein FAK is
	involved in the doxorubicin-induced activation of the PI-3 kinase/PKB
	signaling route, thereby suppressing the onset of apoptosis caused
	by doxorubicin.},

	a biochemical and functional level. Moreover, overexpression and/or
	increased activity of FAK is common in a wide variety of human cancers,

	role of FAK in a large number of processes involved in tumorigenesis,
	metastasis and survival signalling FAK should be regarded as a potential

@article{Panani:2006,
	abstract = {Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and its pathogenesis
	is closely associated with tobacco smoking. Continuous exposure of
	smoking carcinogens results in the accumulation of several alterations
	of tumorigenesis related genes leading to neoplastic bronchial lesions.
	Lung cancer is divided in two main histological groups, non-small
	cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) and small cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs).
	It seems that lung tumorigenesis is a multistep process in which
	a number of genetic events including alterations of oncogenes and
	tumor suppressor genes have been occurred. Cytogenetic abnormalities
	in lung cancer are very complex. However, a number of recurrent cytogenetic
	abnormalities have been identified. Many of these changes are common
	in both major histological groups of lung cancer while certain chromosomal
	abnormalities have been correlated with the stage or the grade of
	the tumors. In addition, several molecular alterations have been
	constantly found. Some of them are common in different histological
	subtypes of lung cancer and they appear to play an important role
	in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. A good understanding of the underlying
	genetic changes of lung tumorigenesis will provide new perspectives
	for early diagnosis and screening of high-risk individuals. In addition,
	a number of genetical prognostic factors have been identified as
	possibly helpful parameters in the evaluation of lung cancer patients.
	Further research is required in order to systematically investigate
	genetical alterations in lung cancer contributing to improvement
	of lung cancer classification and staging and to development of new
	molecular targeted therapies.},

	comparable results. For each of the three microarray platforms tested,
	the results show good agreement with high correlation coefficients
	and high concordance of differentially expressed gene lists within

@article{Paus:1996,
	abstract = {The location and possible function of the human frontal eye-field
	(FEF) were evaluated by reviewing results of cerebral blood-flow
	(CBF) and lesion studies. A remarkable consistency was found regarding
	the rostro-caudal (Y: from -6 to 1 mm) and dorso-ventral (Z: from
	44 to 51 mm) location of the FEF, as defined by the CBF method within
	a standardized stereotaxic system (the zero point for all X, Y and
	Z coordinates coinciding with the anterior commissure, Talairach
	and Tournoux [Co-planar Stereotactic Atlas of the Human Brain, Georg
	Thieme, Stuttgart, 1988]. In contrast, there was a marked variability
	along the mediolateral axis (X: from -24 to -40 mm for the left hemisphere
	and from 21 to 40 mm for the right hemisphere). The human FEF is
	thus located either in the vicinity of the precentral sulcus and/or
	in the depth of the caudalmost part of the superior frontal sulcus.
	In either case, this location challenges the commonly held view of
	the FEF being located in Broadmann's area 8. With regard to FEF function,
	the results of CBF studies failed to support a role for the FEF in
	the cognitive aspects of oculomotor control, such as the execution
	of anti-saccades. Blood-flow activation data are consistent in this
	respect with the results of lesion studies. It is proposed that future
	research on FEF function in human subjects may benefit from focusing
	on the visuomotor rather than the cognitive aspects of oculomotor
	control.},

@article{Pietrzyk:1994,
	abstract = {A multipurpose three-dimensional registration technique was validated
	with PET, SPECT, CT and MRI scans, which had been obtained under
	normal clinical conditions. In contrast to fully automated procedures,
	this coregistration method is highly interactive, which has the advantage
	that it does not impose rigid restrictions by data type and by alterations
	in normal anatomy or brain function resulting from disease. METHODS:
	Basically, a computer program provides a variety of tools to examine
	the accuracy of coregistration visually and to specify necessary
	translations and rotations in all three dimensions. Tools and criteria
	to accept coregistration were applied according to a standardized
	protocol. Reproducibility was assessed with five independent users
	on nine pairs of image sets. In two pairs of these image sets, coregistration
	was repeated three times by each user. RESULTS: Depending on the
	resolution of the images involved, the reproducibility of translation
	distances ranged from 0.32 to 2.22 mm (s.d.) and of rotation angles
	from 0.32 to 1.70 degrees. It was always much smaller than the point-spread
	full-width half maximum of the device with the lower resolution.
	The accuracy of coregistration was examined using two arbitrarily
	misplaced image sets. Interindividual and intraindividual variance
	were similar, which suggested that the influence of subjectivity
	was not significant. Average displacements after coregistration were
	0.43 and 0.29 mm or less for PET and MRI data, respectively, which
	indicated the absence of a systematic bias. CONCLUSION: The results
	indicate the high reproducibility and accuracy of this three-dimensional
	coregistration technique, which is comparable or superior to those
	of automated techniques and methods based on external artificial
	landmarks.},

	abstract = {A method has been developed to create corresponding brain slices from
	morphological [CT, magnetic resonance (MR)] and functional [positron
	emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography]
	tomographic studies in individual patients. It does not require special
	headholders or definition of specific landmarks and is fully retrospective.
	Three-dimensional image registration in corresponding orientation
	is achieved by linear interpolation of original slices and a variety
	of interactively controlled video display options. These include
	simultaneous display of multiple slices and brain cuts in all three
	dimensions for comparison of positioning. Brain contours in one imaging
	modality may be enhanced by appropriate filtering and superimposed
	onto reference images of another modality. Matching accuracy depends
	on image resolution; misalignment of 4 mm was detected unambiguously
	in sample studies (fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET matched with MR).
	The technique is equally well applicable to normals and to patients
	with structural brain lesions. Additional options for shaded surface
	display enhance the power to identify neuroanatomical structures
	in functional image analysis. As demonstrated in the example of MR-guided
	PET, this modeling procedure can be successfully used for identification
	of brain structures on functional images, even in patients with pathologically
	altered brain morphology.},

	abstract = {The relationships of the "primary" cytoarchitectonic neocortical fields,
	17, 41, 3b, and 4 (Brodmann areas), to salient topographic landmarks
	have been reconstructed from serial histological sections in 20 human
	cerebral hemispheres (10 brains). Each of these architectonic fields
	is found to bear a characteristic relationship to a set of enframing
	anatomic landmarks, in particular, gyri, fissures, and sulci, that
	can be readily defined by MRI. Two classes of variability were found
	characteristic, at least to some extent, of each of the fields. Class
	1 variability--variability that is not predictable from visible landmarks--was
	typical of the polar and for the cuneal and lingual extracalcarine
	distributions of field 17 and the distribution of field 4 upon the
	paracentral lobule. Class 2 variability--variability that is closely
	predictable from visible landmarks--is seen in the marked interindividual
	or interhemispheric variation in size or shape of a field and was
	found to be prominent for all four fields. Because of the prominence
	of class 2 variability, direct reference to the landmarks that frame
	these fields may be expected to be a more reliable basis for functional
	mapping than reference to a template or stereotactic coordinate-based
	system of reference to a standard or idealized brain.},

@article{Rademacher:1992,
	abstract = {We describe a system of parcellation of the human brain that is based
	on the functional anatomy of the cerebral cortex and that is applied
	to the analysis of magnetic resonance images. This system is designed
	to support investigations of hemispheric asymmetries and quantitative
	lesion localization studies in cognitive neuroscience. The system
	of cortical subdivision is a neural systems oriented model that approximates
	subdivisions supported by previous architectonic and functional analyses.
	It is based primarily on boundaries determined by "limiting fissures."
	It is completed by a set of coronal planes, keyed to visible anatomic
	landmarks, which "close" the borders of the parcellation subdivisions.
	The method depends on computational reconstruction of the primary
	image data in multiple planes so as to allow the observed pattern
	of limiting fissures in a given brain to be digitized. In this presentation,
	the method is applied in order to define the surface anatomy of the
	cerebral hemispheres in a normal subject. Volumetric measurements
	of individual cortical regions are compared as hemispheric percentiles
	to areal percentiles derived from the analysis of Jouandet et al.
	(1989), a conceptually related though methodologically different
	approach. We specifically address the approach to the study of interhemispheric
	differences and interindividual variations in cortical anatomy.},

@article{Rebhan:1998,
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Modern biology is shifting from the 'one gene one postdoc'
	approach to genomic analyses that include the simultaneous monitoring
	of thousands of genes. The importance of efficient access to concise
	and integrated biomedical information to support data analysis and
	decision making is therefore increasing rapidly, in both academic
	and industrial research. However, knowledge discovery in the widely
	scattered resources relevant for biomedical research is often a cumbersome
	and non-trivial task, one that requires a significant amount of training
	and effort. RESULTS: To develop a model for a new type of topic-specific
	overview resource that provides efficient access to distributed information,
	we designed a database called 'GeneCards'. It is a freely accessible
	Web resource that offers one hypertext 'card' for each of the more
	than 7000 human genes that currently have an approved gene symbol
	published by the HUGO/GDB nomenclature committee. The presented information
	aims at giving immediate insight into current knowledge about the
	respective gene, including a focus on its functions in health and
	disease. It is compiled by Perl scripts that automatically extract
	relevant information from several databases, including SWISS-PROT,
	OMIM, Genatlas and GDB. Analyses of the interactions of users with
	the Web interface of GeneCards triggered development of easy-to-scan
	displays optimized for human browsing. Also, we developed algorithms
	that offer 'ready-to-click' query reformulation support, to facilitate
	information retrieval and exploration. Many of the long-term users
	turn to GeneCards to quickly access information about the function
	of very large sets of genes, for example in the realm of large-scale
	expression studies using 'DNA chip' technology or two-dimensional
	protein electrophoresis. Availability: Freely available at http://bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/cards/

@article{Reiss:1996,
	abstract = {Normal brain development during childhood is a complex and dynamic
	process for which detailed scientific information is lacking. MRI
	techniques, combined with methods for advanced image analysis, offer
	the potential to begin to construct a quantitative map of normal
	paediatric brain development in vivo. In this study we utilize volumetric
	analysis of high resolution brain images obtained from MRI to describe
	cerebral development and morphology in 85 normal children and adolescents
	ranging in age from 5 to 17 years. The results show that total cerebral
	volume is 10\% larger in boys compared with girls. However, both
	boys and girls show little change in total cerebral volume after
	the age of 5 years. Increased cortical grey matter is the primary
	contributor to larger brain volume in boys, thus supporting the hypothesis
	that gender associated differences in brain size are related to differences
	in cortical neuronal density. Prominent, age-related changes in grey
	matter, white matter and CSF volumes are evident during childhood
	and appear to reflect ongoing maturation and remodelling of the CNS.
	Both boys and girls show a similar pattern of cerebral asymmetry;
	a rightward prominence of cortical and subcortical grey matter and
	a leftward prominence of CSF is observed. IQ is positively correlated
	with total cerebral volume in children, in particular, with the volume
	of cortical grey matter in the prefrontal region of the brain. Subcortical
	grey matter also contributes to the variance in IQ, although to a
	lesser extent than cortical grey volume. Quantitative knowledge of
	the developing human brain will play an increasingly greater role
	in improving sensitivity and specificity in the interpretation of
	brain abnormalities in patients within the clinical environment,
	as well as in groups of children with suspected brain dysfunction
	in the research setting.},

	abstract = {{During the last five years, the development of bioinformatics and
	EST databases has been primarily responsible for the identification
	of many new chemokines and chemokine receptors. The chemokine field
	has also received considerable attention since chemokine receptors
	were found to act as co-receptors for HIV infection (1). In addition,
	chemokines, along with adhesion molecules, are crucial during inflammatory
	responses for a timely recruitment of specific leukocyte subpopulations
	to sites of tissue damage. However, chemokines and their receptors
	are also important in dendritic cell maturation (2), B (3), and T
	(4) cell development, Th1 and Th2 responses, infections, angiogenesis,
	and tumor growth as well as metastasis (5). Furthermore, an increase
	in the number of chemokine/receptor transgenic and knock-out mice
	has helped to define the functions of chemokines in vivo. In this
	review we discuss some of the chemokines' biological effects in vivo
	and in vitro, described in the last few years, and the implications
	of these findings when considering chemokine receptors as therapeutic
	targets.}},

	(MR) brain images. The approach we take is to model a prelabeled
	brain atlas as a physical object and give it elastic properties,
	allowing it to warp itself onto regions in a preprocessed image.
	Preprocessing consists of boundary-finding and a morphological procedure
	which automatically extracts the brain and sulci from an MR image
	and provides a smoothed representation of the brain surface to which
	the deformable model can rapidly converge. Our deformable models
	are energy-minimizing elastic surfaces that can accurately locate
	image features. The models are parameterized with 3-D bicubic B-spline
	surfaces. We design the energy function such that cortical fissure
	(sulci) points on the model are attracted to fissure points on the
	image and the remaining model points are attracted to the brain surface.
	A conjugate gradient method minimizes the energy function, allowing
	the model to automatically converge to the smoothed brain surface.
	Finally, labels are propagated from the deformed atlas onto the high-resolution
	brain surface.},

@article{Senger:1993,
	abstract = {{Vascular permeability factor (VPF), also known as vascular endothelial
	growth factor (VEGF), is a multifunctional cytokine expressed and
	secreted at high levels by many tumor cells of animal and human origin.
	As secreted by tumor cells, VPF/VEGF is a 34-42 kDa heparin-binding,
	dimeric, disulfide-bonded glycoprotein that acts directly on endothelial
	cells (EC) by way of specific receptors to activate phospholipase
	C and induce {[}Ca2+]i transients. Two high affinity VPF/VEGF receptors,
	both tyrosine kinases, have thus far been described. VPF/VEGF is
	likely to have a number of important roles in tumor biology related,
	but not limited to, the process of tumor angiogenesis. As a potent
	permeability factor, VPF/VEGF promotes extravasation of plasma fibrinogen,
	leading to fibrin deposition which alters the tumor extracellular
	matrix. This matrix promotes the ingrowth of macrophages, fibroblasts,
	and endothelial cells. Moreover, VPF/VEGF is a selective endothelial
	cell (EC) growth factor in vitro, and it presumably stimulates EC
	proliferation in vivo. Furthermore, VPF/VEGF has been found in animal
	and human tumor effusions by immunoassay and by functional assays
	and very likely accounts for the induction of malignant ascites.
	In addition to its role in tumors, VPF/VEGF has recently been found
	to have a role in wound healing and its expression by activated macrophages
	suggests that it probably also participates in certain types of chronic
	inflammation. VPF/VEGF is expressed in normal development and in
	certain normal adult organs, notably kidney, heart, adrenal gland
	and lung. Its functions in normal adult tissues are under investigation.}},

	abstract = {GeneCards is an automatically mined database of human genes that strives
	to create, along with its auxiliary databases--GeneLoc, GeneNote
	and GeneAnnot--the most inclusive resource of gene-centered information
	of the human genome. GeneTide, the Gene Terra Incognita Discovery
	Endeavor (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/genetide/), the newest
	addition to this family, is a transcriptome-focused database which
	aims to enhance GeneCards with additional expressed sequence tag
	(EST)-based genes. This is achieved by comprehensively mapping >85\%
	of the approximately 5.6 million human ESTs currently available at
	dbEST to known genes by means of data mining and integration of genomic
	resources including UniGene, DoTS, AceView and in-house resources.
	GeneTide thus creates comprehensive links between ESTs and GeneCards
	genes. Furthermore, groups of unassociated transcripts serve as a
	basis for defining novel EST-based GeneCards Candidates (EGCs). These
	EGCs, nearly 25,000 of which were defined in version 0.3 of GeneTide,
	are further annotated with various parameters, including splicing
	evidence and expression data extracted from the GeneNote database,
	to determine their validity as possible de novo genes.},

	abstract = {The [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) method for measuring brain
	metabolism has not the wide clinical application that one might expect,
	partly because of its high cost and the complexity of the quantification
	procedure, but also because of reporting techniques based on region
	of interest (ROI) analysis, which are time-consuming and not fully
	objective. In this paper we report a clinical validation of statistical
	parametric mapping (SPM) using rCMRglc (quantitative) and radioactivity
	distribution (nonquantitative) [18F]FDG PET data. We show that a
	10-min noninteractive voxel-based SPM analysis on a standard workstation
	enables objective assessment, including localization in stereotactic
	space, of regional glucose consumption abnormalities, whose reliability
	can be assessed on statistical and clinical grounds. Clinical validity
	was established using a small series of patients with degenerative
	or developmental disorders, including probable Alzheimer's disease,
	progressive aphasia, multiple sclerosis, developmental specific language
	impairment, and epilepsy. Analysis of quantitative and nonquantitative
	data showed the same pattern of results, suggesting that, for clinical
	purposes, quantitation and invasive arterial cannulation can be avoided.
	This should facilitate a wider application of the technique and the
	extension of SPM clinical analysis to H215O PET or high resolution
	SPECT perfusion studies.},

@article{Slebos:1989,
	abstract = {With the development of molecular biological techniques the search
	for genetic alterations in cancer cells has resulted in the beginning
	of a molecular description of cellular transformation. Most of these
	genetic changes occur in genes which have a role in the control of
	cellular growth and development, the proto oncogenes. In the last
	decade, it has become clear that the myc and ras oncogene families
	are important in the carcinogenesis of human lung cancers. The myc
	oncogenes are usually found to be altered in small cell lung cancer
	(SCLC), and these alterations appear to correlate with rapid growth
	and progression. Mutations in the Kras gene are specific for adenocarcinoma,
	a subclass of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Kras gene mutations
	are closely associated with tobacco smoking, since all were found
	in adenocarcinomas from patients with a history of smoking. The erbB
	oncogene, which encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, is
	often highly expressed in epidermoid carcinomas. The roles for other
	oncogenes, such as raf or myb, as well as those of "suppressor" genes
	remain to be investigated, but may be of paramount importance. The
	study of alterations in proto oncogenes may aid in the (sub)classification
	and diagnosis of lung cancer, and may yield useful prognostic information
	in the near future.},

	abstract = {Volumetric studies have consistently shown reductions in cerebral
	gray matter volume between childhood and adolescence, with the most
	dramatic changes occurring in the more dorsal cortices of the frontal
	and parietal lobes. The purpose of this study was to examine the
	spatial location of these changes employing methods typical of functional
	imaging studies. T1-weighted structural MRI data (1.2 mm) were analyzed
	for nine normally developing children and nine normal adolescents.
	Validity and reliability of the tissue segmentation protocol were
	assessed as part of several preprocessing analyses prior to statistical
	parametric mapping (SPM). Using SPM96, a simple contrast of average
	gray matter differences between the two age groups revealed 57 significant
	clusters (SPM[Z] height threshold, P<0.001, extent threshold 50,
	uncorrected). The pattern and distribution of differences were consistent
	with earlier findings from the volumetric assessment of the same
	subjects. Specifically, more differences were observed in dorsal
	frontal and parietal regions with relatively few differences observed
	in cortices of the temporal and occipital lobes. Permutation tests
	were conducted to assess the overall significance of the gray matter
	differences and validity of the parametric maps. Twenty SPMs were
	created with subjects randomly assigned to groups. None of the random
	SPMs approached the number of significant clusters observed in the
	age difference SPM (mean number of significant clusters = 5.8). The
	age effects observed appear to result from regions that consistently
	segment as gray matter in the younger group and consistently segment
	as white matter in the older group. The utility of these methods
	for localizing relatively subtle structural changes that occur between
	childhood and adolescence has not previously been examined.},

@article{Spellman:2002,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meaningful exchange of microarray data is currently difficult
	because it is rare that published data provide sufficient information
	depth or are even in the same format from one publication to another.
	Only when data can be easily exchanged will the entire biological
	community be able to derive the full benefit from such microarray
	studies. RESULTS: To this end we have developed three key ingredients
	towards standardizing the storage and exchange of microarray data.
	First, we have created a minimal information for the annotation of
	a microarray experiment (MIAME)-compliant conceptualization of microarray
	experiments modeled using the unified modeling language (UML) named
	MAGE-OM (microarray gene expression object model). Second, we have
	translated MAGE-OM into an XML-based data format, MAGE-ML, to facilitate
	the exchange of data. Third, some of us are now using MAGE (or its
	progenitors) in data production settings. Finally, we have developed
	a freely available software tool kit (MAGE-STK) that eases the integration
	of MAGE-ML into end users' systems. CONCLUSIONS: MAGE will help microarray
	data producers and users to exchange information by providing a common
	platform for data exchange, and MAGE-STK will make the adoption of
	MAGE easier.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether a quantitative MR imaging method to
	map spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) can be used to characterize
	maturational changes in the normal human brain. METHODS: An inversion-recovery
	technique was used to map T1 transversely at the level of the basal
	ganglia in a study population of 19 healthy children (4 to 10 years
	old) and 31 healthy adolescents (10 to 20 years old), and in a normative
	population of 20 healthy adults (20 to 30 years old). RESULTS: Nonparametric
	analysis of variance showed that T1 decreases with age in the genu,
	frontal white matter, caudate, putamen, anterior thalamus, pulvinar
	nucleus, optic radiation, cortical gray matter (all P < .0001), and
	occipital white matter. There was a significant reduction in T1 between
	childhood (mean age, 7.1 +/- 1.4) and adolescence (mean age, 13.5
	+/- 2.6) in all brain structures, but there was also a significant
	reduction in T1 between adolescence (mean age, 13.5 +/- 2.6) and
	adulthood (mean age, 26.5 +/- 3.4) in all brain structures except
	occipital white matter. Regression shows that T1 declines to within
	the range (mean +/- 2 SD) of young adult T1 values by about 2 years
	in the occipital white matter, by about 4 years in the genu, by 11
	years in the cortical gray matter, by 11 years in the frontal white
	matter, and by 13 years in the thalamus. CONCLUSION: Brain structures
	mature at strikingly different rates, yet the ratio of gray matter
	T1 to white matter T1 does not change significantly with age. Thus,
	conventional MR imaging methods based on inherent contrast are insensitive
	to these changes. Age-related changes tend to reach completion sooner
	in white matter than in gray matter tracts. Such normative data are
	essential for studies of specific pediatric disorders and may be
	useful for assessing brain maturation in cases of developmental delay.},

	a functional modality (SPECT, PET, functional magnetic resonance

	visualization of SPECT and magnetic resonance brain images, where
	MRI is used as a framework of reference for the display of the SPECT
	data. METHODS: A novel technique for three-dimensional integrated
	visualization of functional and anatomical information, called normal
	fusion, is presented. With this technique, local functional information
	is projected onto an anatomic structure. RESULTS: The normal fusion
	technique is applied to three cases of SPECT/MRI integration. The
	results are presented, discussed and evaluated for clinical relevance.
	CONCLUSION: The results for three-dimensional integrated display
	of SPECT and MR brain images indicate that the normal fusion technique
	provides a potentially comprehensive and diagnostically valuable
	presentation of cerebral blood perfusion in relation to the anatomy

	abstract = {We analyzed local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (LCMRglu) in
	20 regions from 22 patients with complex partial seizures, who were
	taking neither phenytoin nor phenobarbital and who had normal CTs.
	Results were compared with data from 19 normal controls. Ten patients
	had left temporal, eight right temporal, and four bitemporal or generalized
	EEG discharges. There were no significant differences between patient
	and control values in any of 20 regions of interest. LCMRglu was
	depressed at the site of the epileptic focus: L/R ratio was 0.85
	+/- 0.12 (p less than 0.003 compared with control), 0.92 +/- 0.08
	(p less than 0.05), and 0.84 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001), respectively,
	in mesial, superior, and inferior temporal regions for patients with
	left temporal foci; 1.7 +/- 0.96 (p less than 0.04), 1.1 +/- 0.1
	(NS), and 1.15 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.001) for patients with right
	temporal foci. Patients with left temporal EEG foci had significantly
	lower values than patients with right temporal foci in left superior
	frontal and thalamic as well as left temporal regions, while patients
	with right-sided EEG foci had depressed LCMRglu (compared with patients
	with left temporal EEG foci) restricted to right mesial temporal
	lobe. The patients with left temporal foci tended to have longer
	seizure histories (22.7 +/- 5.4 versus 11 +/- 5.6 years; p less than
	0.001). There was an inverse correlation between length of seizure
	history and mean LCMRglu (r = 0.38; 0.1 greater than p greater than
	0.05). Our study suggests that LCMRglu is not depressed in regions
	beyond the epileptic focus when patients are not taking drugs known
	to decrease cerebral glucose metabolism.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We have devised, implemented, and tested a technique for
	creating a comprehensive probabilistic atlas of the human cerebral
	cortex, based on high-dimensional fluid transformations. The goal
	of the atlas is to detect and quantify subtle and distributed patterns
	of deviation from normal cortical anatomy, in a 3D brain image from
	any given subject. METHOD: Given a 3D MR image of a new subject,
	a high-resolution surface representation of the cerebral cortex is
	automatically extracted. The algorithm then calculates a set of high-dimensional
	volumetric maps, fluidly deforming this surface into structural correspondence
	with other cortical surfaces, selected one by one from an anatomic
	image database. The family of volumetric warps so constructed encodes
	statistical properties of local anatomical variation across the cortical
	surface. Additional strategies are developed to fluidly deform the
	sulcal patterns of different subjects into structural correspondence.
	A probability space of random transformations, based on the theory
	of anisotropic Gaussian random fields, is then used to encode information
	on complex variations in gyral and sulcal topography from one individual
	to another. A complete system of 256(2) probability density functions
	is computed to reflect the observed variability in stereotaxic space
	of the points whose correspondences are found by the warping algorithm.
	Confidence limits in stereotaxic space are determined for cortical
	surface points in the new subject's brain. RESULTS: Color-coded probability
	maps are generated, which highlight and quantify regional patterns
	of deformity in the anatomy of new subjects. These maps indicate
	locally the probability of each anatomic point being as unusually
	situated, given the distributions of corresponding points in the
	scans of normal subjects. 3D MRI volumes are analyzed, from subjects
	with clinically determined Alzheimer disease and age-matched normal
	subjects. CONCLUSION: Applications of the random fluid-based probabilistic
	atlas include the transfer of multisubject 3D functional, vascular,
	and histologic maps onto a single anatomic template, the mapping
	of 3D atlases onto the scans of new subjects, and the rapid detection,
	quantification, and mapping of local shape changes in 3D medical
	images in disease and during normal or abnormal growth and development.},

	in surface features of the cortex. Statistical analysis of sulcal
	geometry will facilitate multisubject atlasing, neurosurgical studies,
	and multimodality brain mapping applications. This investigation
	describes the variability in location and geometry of five sulci
	surveyed in each hemisphere of six postmortem human brains placed
	within the Talairach stereotaxic grid. The sulci were modeled as
	complex internal surfaces in the brain. Heterogeneous profiles of
	three-dimensional (3D) variation were quantified locally within individual
	sulci. Whole human heads, sectioned at 50 micrometer, were digitally
	photographed and high-resolution 3D data volumes were reconstructed.
	The parieto-occipital sulcus, the anterior and posterior rami of
	the calcarine sulcus, the cingulate and marginal sulci, and the supracallosal
	sulcus were delineated manually on sagittally resampled sections.
	Sulcal outlines were reparameterized for surface comparisons. Statistics
	of 3D variation for arbitrary points on each surface were calculated
	locally from the standardized individual data. Additional measures
	of surface area, extent in three dimensions, surface curvature, and
	fractal dimension were used to characterize variations in sulcal
	geometry. Paralimbic sulci exhibited a greater degree of anterior-posterior
	variability than vertical variability. Occipital sulci displayed
	the reverse trend. Both trends were consistent with developmental
	growth patterns. Points on the occipital sulci displayed a profile
	of variability highly correlated with their 3D distance from the
	posterior commissure. Surface curvature was greater for the arched
	paralimbic sulci than for those bounding occipital gyri in each hemisphere.
	On the other hand, fractal dimension measures were remarkably similar
	for all sulci examined, and no significant hemispheric asymmetries
	were found for any of the selected spatial and geometric parameters.
	Implications of cortical morphometric variability for multisubject
	comparisons and brain mapping applications are discussed.},

	structures have complicated the problem of quantifying deviations
	from normal anatomy and of developing standardized neuroanatomical
	atlases. This paper describes the design, implementation, and results
	of a technique for creating a three-dimensional (3D) probabilistic
	surface atlas of the human brain. We have developed, implemented,
	and tested a new 3D statistical method for assessing structural variations
	in a data-base of anatomic images. The algorithm enables the internal
	surface anatomy of new subjects to be analyzed at an extremely local
	level. The goal was to quantify subtle and distributed patterns of
	deviation from normal anatomy by automatically generating detailed
	probability maps of the anatomy of new subjects. Connected systems
	of parametric meshes were used to model the internal course of the
	following structures in both hemispheres: the parieto-occipital sulcus,
	the anterior and posterior rami of the calcarine sulcus, the cingulate
	and marginal sulci, and the supracallosal sulcus. These sulci penetrate
	sufficiently deeply into the brain to introduce an obvious topological

	was constructed, encoding statistical properties of local anatomical

	abstract = {Striking variations in brain structure, especially in the gyral patterns
	of the human cortex, present fundamental challenges in human brain
	mapping. Probabilistic brain atlases, which encode information on
	structural and functional variability in large human populations,
	are powerful research tools with broad applications. Knowledge-based
	imaging algorithms can also leverage atlased information on anatomic
	variation. Applications include automated image labeling, pathology
	detection in individuals or groups, and investigating how regional
	anatomy is altered in disease, and with age, gender, handedness and
	other clinical or genetic factors. In this report, we illustrate
	some of the mathematical challenges involved in constructing population-based
	brain atlases. A disease-specific atlas is constructed to represent
	the human brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specialized strategies
	are developed for population-based averaging of anatomy. Sets of
	high-dimensional elastic mappings, based on the principles of continuum
	mechanics, reconfigure the anatomy of a large number of subjects
	in an anatomic image database. These mappings generate a local encoding
	of anatomic variability and are used to create a crisp anatomical
	image template with highly resolved structures in their mean spatial
	location. Specialized approaches are also developed to average cortical
	topography. Since cortical patterns are altered in a variety of diseases,
	gyral pattern matching is used to encode the magnitude and principal
	directions of local cortical variation. In the resulting cortical
	templates, subtle features emerge. Regional asymmetries appear that
	are not apparent in individual anatomies. Population-based maps of
	cortical variation reveal a mosaic of variability patterns that segregate

	abstract = {Preterm birth occurs at a rate of 12.7\% in the U.S. and is the primary
	cause of fetal morbidity in the first year of life as well as the
	cause of later health problems. Elucidation of mechanisms controlling
	cervical remodeling is critical for development of therapies to reduce
	the incidence of prematurity. The cervical extracellular matrix must
	be disorganized during labor to allow birth, followed by a rapid
	repair postpartum. Leukocytes infiltrate the cervix before and after
	birth and are proposed to regulate matrix remodeling during cervical
	ripening via release of proteolytic enzymes. In the current study,
	flow cytometry and cell sorting were used to determine the role of
	immune cells in cervical matrix remodeling before, during, and after
	parturition. Markers of myeloid cell differentiation and activation
	were assessed to define phenotype and function. Tissue monocytes
	and eosinophils increased in the cervix before birth in a progesterone-regulated
	fashion, whereas macrophage numbers were unchanged. Neutrophils increased
	in the postpartum period. Increased mRNA expression of Csfr1 and
	markers of alternatively activated M2 macrophages during labor or
	shortly postpartum suggest a function of M2 macrophages in postpartum
	tissue repair. Changes in cervical myeloid cell numbers are not reflected
	in the peripheral blood. These data along with our previous studies
	suggest that myeloid-derived cells do not orchestrate processes required
	for initiation of cervical ripening before birth. Additionally, macrophages
	with diverse phenotypes (M1 and M2) are present in the cervix and
	are most likely involved in the postpartum repair of tissue.},

	of biomarkers which are under investigation. However, most important
	biomarkers in a clinical setting are ER (estrogen receptors) and
	HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), but still only
	as predictive markers for tamoxifen and trastuzumab therapy. Their
	prognostic role is still subject of investigation. On the other hand,
	although, TGF-beta1 is known as marker of invasiveness and metastatic
	capacity of breast cancer cells, this marker has never been considered
	to be introduced in routine clinical setting. TGF-beta1 is ER regulated
	biomarker which act synergistically with HER-2. Aim of this study
	is to show that clinical significance of determination ER and HER-2
	status could be improved, when they are related with TGF-beta1 as
	additional biomarker. It seems that TGF-beta1 could make a difference
	regarding prognosis and prediction in breast cancer patients. This

@article{Townsend:2002,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methods of microarray analysis that suit experimentalists
	using the technology are vital. Many methodologies discard the quantitative
	results inherent in cDNA microarray comparisons or cannot be flexibly
	applied to multifactorial experimental design. Here we present a
	flexible, quantitative Bayesian framework. This framework can be
	used to analyze normalized microarray data acquired by any replicated
	experimental design in which any number of treatments, genotypes,
	or developmental states are studied using a continuous chain of comparisons.
	RESULTS: We apply this method to Saccharomyces cerevisiae microarray
	datasets on the transcriptional response to ethanol shock, to SNF2
	and SWI1 deletion in rich and minimal media, and to wild-type and
	zap1 expression in media with high, medium, and low levels of zinc.
	The method is highly robust to missing data, and yields estimates
	of the magnitude of expression differences and experimental error
	variances on a per-gene basis. It reveals genes of interest that
	are differentially expressed at below the twofold level, genes with
	high 'fold-change' that are not statistically significantly different,
	and genes differentially regulated in quantitatively unanticipated
	ways. CONCLUSIONS: Anyone with replicated normalized cDNA microarray
	ratio datasets can use the freely available MacOS and Windows software,
	which yields increased biological insight by taking advantage of
	replication to discern important changes in expression level both
	above and below a twofold threshold. Not only does the method have
	utility at the moment, but also, within the Bayesian framework, there
	will be considerable opportunity for future development.},

	cells grown under two different conditions using cDNA microarray
	data. We use a quality index, computed from duplicate spots on the
	same slide, to filter out outlying spots, poor quality genes and
	problematical slides. We also perform calibration experiments to
	show that normalization between fluorescent labels is needed and
	that the normalization is slide dependent and non-linear. A rank
	invariant method is suggested to select non-differentially expressed
	genes and to construct normalization curves in comparative experiments.
	After normalization the residuals from the calibration data are used
	to provide prior information on variance components in the analysis
	of comparative experiments. Based on a hierarchical model that incorporates
	several levels of variations, a method for assessing the significance
	of gene effects in comparative experiments is presented. The analysis
	is demonstrated via two groups of experiments with 125 and 4129 genes,
	respectively, in Escherichia coli grown in glucose and acetate.},

	30\%, of that in the nonpregnant cervix. After delivery, no further

	increased. An increase in the collagenolytic activity was observed
	with advancing gestational age. The 2,4-dinitrophenyl-Pro-Gln-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Gin-D-Arg
	hydrolytic activity (collagenase) and the concentration of leukocyte
	elastase increased gradually by a factor of 10. The physiologic importance

	Using the principal curvatures of the resulting surface, we then
	identify the edges on the sulci on it, and we initialize active contours
	along them. An external force field guides an active contour to the
	deep edge of a sulcus, along the medial surface of a cortical fold.
	A parametric description of a sulcal surface is obtained as the active
	contour traverses the sulcus, sweeping a surface resembling a convoluted
	ribbon embedded in 3D. In this paper we present results using magnetic

@article{VanBogaert:1998,
	abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
	studies of 42 subjects ages 6 to 38 years were analyzed using statistical
	parametric mapping to identify age-related changes in regional distribution
	of glucose metabolism adjusted for global activity. Whereas adults
	were normal volunteers, children had idiopathic epilepsy. We studied
	polynomial expansions of age to identify nonlinear effects and found
	that adjusted glucose metabolism varied very significantly in the
	thalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex and to a lesser degree
	in the basal ganglia, the mesencephalon, and the insular, posterior
	cingulate, frontal, and postcentral cortices. Regression plots slowed
	that the best fit was not linear: adjusted glucose metabolism increased
	mainly before the age of 25 years and then remained relatively stable.
	Effects persisted when anti-epileptic drug intake and sleep during
	the FDG uptake were considered as confounding covariates. To determine
	if the metabolic changes observed were not due to the epileptic condition
	of the children, PET data obtained in adults with temporal lobe epilepsy
	were compared with those in our group of normal adult subjects, resulting
	in the absence of mapping in the age-related regions. This study
	suggests that brain maturation from the age of 6 years gives rise
	to a relative increase of synaptic activities in the thalamus, possibly
	as a consequence of improved corticothalamic connections. Increased
	metabolic activity in the anterior cingulate cortex is probably related
	to these thalamic changes and suggests that the limbic system is
	involved in the processes of brain maturation.},

	abstract = {It is now widely accepted that human carcinogenesis is a multi-step
	process and phenotypic changes during cancer progression reflect
	the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations in cells. The
	recent progress of scientific research has notably increased knowledge
	about biological events involved in lung cancer pathogenesis and
	progression, thanks to the use of molecular biology and immunohistochemistry
	techniques. Lots of the genetic alteration found in small cells lung
	cancer (SCLC) and in not small cells lung cancer (NSCLC) concern
	the expression of cell cycle genes, actually recognized as onco-suppressor
	genes and the lack of equilibrium between oncogenes and oncosuppressor
	genes. The present review of literature widely describes the cell
	cycle control, the lung cancer molecular pathogenesis, the catalog
	of known genetic alterations and the recent advances in global expression
	profiles in lung tumors, on the basis of the various hystological
	types too. Such data suggest the potential use of this knowledges
	in clinical practice both as prognostic factors and innovative therapeutic
	possibilities and they impose the necessity of new studies about
	cell cycle control and lung carcinogenesis.},

	image registration using an automated method (AIR 3.0) based on voxel
	intensity. METHOD: PET and MRI data from 22 normal subjects were
	registered to corresponding averaged PET or MRI brain atlases using
	several specific linear and nonlinear spatial transformation models
	with an automated algorithm. Validation was based on anatomically
	defined landmarks. RESULTS: Automated registration produced results
	that were superior to a manual nine parameter variant of the Talairach
	registration method. Increasing the degrees of freedom in the spatial
	transformation model improved the accuracy of automated intersubject
	registration. CONCLUSION: Linear or nonlinear automated intersubject
	registration based on voxel intensities is computationally practical
	and produces more accurate alignment of homologous landmarks than
	manual nine parameter Talairach registration. Nonlinear models provide
	better registration than linear models but are slower.},

	abstract = {The cervix serves as a protective barrier from invading microorganisms
	and as a structural barrier to delivery of the fetus. Among all biological
	processes, the phenomenal connective tissue remodeling that occurs
	in the cervix during and after parturition is unparalleled in scope
	and magnitude. The process of connective tissue remodeling in the
	cervix during pregnancy occurs in four stages: softening, ripening,
	dilation, and repair. Although overlapping in time, each stage is
	uniquely regulated. Results from studies using serial measurements
	of cervical length indicate that cervical ripening precedes myometrial
	contractions of labor by several weeks, suggesting that parturition
	in women is a process of long duration and that uterine contractions
	of labor are late events in the parturition process. A clear understanding
	of the biologic mechanisms that regulate cervical remodeling during
	pregnancy is needed to influence the preterm birth rate and to develop
	strategies to prevent preterm dilation of the cervix.},

	value decomposition to construct a family of candidate solutions
	and then uses robust regression to identify the solution with the
	smallest number of connections as the most likely solution. Our algorithm

	and the SJava system to integrate R and Java and (3) the system is
	also deployed as a publicly available web tool. AVAILABILITY: Our
